"Purpose: Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common disease, often associated with a Baker's cyst.  Besides osteoarthritis, also other joint pathologies of the knee can be causative for a Baker's cyst.  Radiotherapy is known to be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect.  As the excessive production of synovia usually is associated with intraarticular inflammation, our hypothesis was that radiotherapy might positively influence the synovial production and reduce the volume of a Baker's cyst.  Materials and methods: We performed a prospective trial, including 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis.  Besides documentation of NRS (numeric rating scale), WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score and Knee Society Score, the volume of the Baker's cyst was calculated for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up.  Ultrasonic volumetry was performed using an ultrasound device with a high-resolution multifrequency linear probe (6-9 MHz).  Results: Low-dose radiotherapy improved NRS, WOMAC score and Knee Society Score significantly.  The mean volume of Baker's cyst decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively 3.1 ml during follow-up.  A decrease in volume of more than 25% compared to the baseline could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up.  Conclusion: Radiotherapy of knee osteoarthritis is an effective treatment that decreases the volume of a Baker's cyst.  Most patients respond to the treatment.  Whether radiotherapy is an effective treatment for Baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis has to be further examined.",joint inflammation of the right knee .

"Background: This study aimed to compare the arthroscopic internal drainage of popliteal cysts alone or in combination with cyst wall resection in terms of clinical outcomes.  Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts received arthroscopic treatment.  Specifically, 20 of them received arthroscopic internal drainage (AI group) alone and 22 received arthroscopic internal drainage combined with cyst wall resection (AICR group) through double posteromedial portals.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to identify recurrence of popliteal cysts.  The Lysholm score and Rauschning-Lindgren grade were used to assess the clinical outcomes.  The median of the follow-up period was 24 months (12-48 months). Results: The two groups (AI group and AICR group) were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, preoperative Lysholm score, preoperative Rauschning-Lindgren grade and follow-up period (P > 0.05).  Relative to the AI group, the AICR group had a significantly prolonged operation time (P < 0.05) and a higher incidence of complications (P < 0.05).  In both groups, the Rauschning-Lindgren grade at the last follow-up significantly differed from the preoperative grade (P < 0.05) and the Lysholm knee score remarkably increased compared to the preoperative score (P < 0.05); however, there were no differences between the two groups at the last follow-up (P > 0.05).  According to the MRI results, the cyst disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in size in 6 (30%) and existed in 3 (15%) patients in the AI group, and was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in size in 4 (18.2%) patients in the AICR group, suggesting a significant difference between the two (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Additional resection of cyst wall can result in a lower recurrence rate of cysts but extend the operation time and increase the incidence of perioperative complications compared with arthroscopic internal drainage of popliteal cysts alone.","Toxoplasma gondii causes severe encephalitis in immune compromised hosts after reactivation of brain cysts that persist for the life span of the host . The biological mechanisms of bradyzoite persistence within cysts are not fully understood . The glycosylated cyst wall is thought to play a crucial role in survival of bradyzoites during chronic infection as well as successful oral transmission of infection . Here we have identified the gene encoding cyst wall glycoprotein CST1 . When we delete the CST1 gene , parasites form dramatically fragile brain cysts . Parasites lacking CST1 develop fewer brain cysts , show dysregulation of bradyzoite-specific gene expression and are less able to grow under stressed conditions . The rescue of these phenotypes requires the heavily glycosylated mucin domain of CST1 . These studies demonstrate that the glycosylation of CST1 plays a significant role in the structural integrity and persistence of brain cysts .

"Objective: To review the results of arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts in our centre and analyse outcomes including complications.   Patients: From July 2007 to July 2009, 11 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated arthroscopically.  All of them had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, identify the valvular opening, and the associated intra-articular pathology.  We used the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria for evaluation.  Results: Intra-articular pathology like cartilage degeneration and meniscus tear were commonly associated with popliteal cysts.  All patients achieved symptomatic improvement after treatment and the recurrence rate was low.  No major complications were encountered.  We failed to identify (and correct) any valvular opening in one patient.  Conclusion: From our experience, we conclude that arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cyst with correction of the valvular opening and treatment of associated intra-articular pathology is effective and safe.","Cystic echinococcosis ( CE ) is a parasitic infection of worldwide occurrence transmitted to humans by dogs . After infection cysts develop , mainly in the liver and lung . Ultrasound-based staging of cysts into active , transitional , and inactive has opened new venues for treatment and follow-up . Currently four treatment modalities are in use: ( 1 ) surgery , ( 2 ) percutaneous sterilization techniques , ( 3 ) chemotherapy with benzimidazoles , and ( 4 ) watch and wait for inactive cysts . However , evidence is insufficient for these four modalities , and determining individual treatment options for patients remains controversial . Medical treatment with benzimidazoles started in the 1970s . Important questions remain unanswered , however , such as efficacy stratified by cyst type and the duration of treatment .

"Objective: To review the results of arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts in our centre and analyse outcomes including complications.   Patients: From July 2007 to July 2009, 11 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated arthroscopically.  All of them had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, identify the valvular opening, and the associated intra-articular pathology.  We used the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria for evaluation.  Results: Intra-articular pathology like cartilage degeneration and meniscus tear were commonly associated with popliteal cysts.  All patients achieved symptomatic improvement after treatment and the recurrence rate was low.  No major complications were encountered.  We failed to identify (and correct) any valvular opening in one patient.  Conclusion: From our experience, we conclude that arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cyst with correction of the valvular opening and treatment of associated intra-articular pathology is effective and safe.","Cystic echinococcosis ( CE ) is a parasitic infection of worldwide occurrence transmitted to humans by dogs .

"Popliteal cyst is a common peri-knee cyst, also known as a Baker's cyst. With the current development of popliteal cysts, the pathogenesis is mainly due to increased pressure in the knee joint caused by various reasons, leading to a fluid-filled sac that can form behind the knee as a result of enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa. The current diagnostic methods include X-ray computed, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance. Among them, magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts. There are various treatments, including conservative treatment, traditional surgical resection and arthroscopic surgery. In recent years, the focus of the treatment of popliteal cysts has gradually shifted from the simple removal of cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, and achieved a good effect. However, there are still controversies about the most effective treatment, and the best surgery method is still uncertained. It is hoped that high quality prospective studies will be able to directly compare different surgery methods, so as to select the best treatment for popliteal cyst. This article reviews past literature research and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, clinical manifestations and signs, auxiliary examination, diagnosis and differential diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts. Different diagnosis methods and treatment methods are compared and summarized to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Cystic echinococcosis ( CE ) is a parasitic infection of worldwide occurrence transmitted to humans by dogs .

"Context: Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are commonly found in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears. Histologically, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue with fibrosis evident, and there may be chronic nonspecific inflammation present. Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may also be found within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. Baker's cysts can be a source of posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they are routinely discovered on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the symptomatic knee. Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin are infrequent and may be related to size. Conclusion: A capsular opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa is a commonly found normal anatomic variant. It is thought that this can lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst in the presence of chronic knee effusions as a result of intra-articular pathology. Management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative. The intra-articular pathology should be first addressed by arthroscopy. If surgical excision later becomes necessary, a limited posteromedial approach is often employed. Other treatments, such as arthroscopic debridement and closure of the valvular mechanism, are not well studied and cannot yet be recommended.",joint inflammation of the right knee .
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to introduce a modified arthroscopic treatment technique for popliteal cyst and hypothesize that this modified technique would provide good clinical efficacy and low recurrence rate. Methods: From January 2013 to January 2017, 34 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated with our technique. A figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals were used to achieve adequate enlargement of the posteromedial valvular opening between the cyst and the joint cavity and complete excision of the cyst wall. MRI was used to detect the recurrence of the popliteal cyst, and the Rauschning and Lindgren score was recorded to evaluate the clinical outcome. Results: All patients were followed up with a mean period of 14.8 months (range, 12 to 36 months). Associated intra-articular lesions were found and treated in all cases. Degenerative cartilage damage was the most common pathology, which affected 23 (67.6%) of the cases. The Rauschning and Lindgren score improved significantly after surgery, and no evidence of recurrence was found from MRI in any case. Conclusions: Our modified arthroscopic treatment technique, using a figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals, is effective and safe for treating popliteal cyst.","Alveolar echinococcosis is one of the mostly deadly human parasitic diseases if left untreated . The treatment of choice is surgical resection , followed by two years of benzimidazole treatment . Unfortunately , only about 30–40% of patients have a resectable disease , while the others require medical treatment with benzimidazoles . As this therapy is only considered to be parasitostatic and as there are not yet reliable tools to assess parasite viability , the treatment usually is life-long . In this study , we evaluated FDG-PET/CT and antibody levels against the recombinant Emll/3-10 antigen as markers for parasite viability , allowing to select patients in whom chemotherapy could be stopped with low risk of AE-recurrence . Eleven 11 patients were identified with negative FDG-PET/CT-scans and anti-EmII/3-10 antibody levels in whom benzimidazole treatment was stopped with no evidence of AE-recurrence within a median follow-up of 70 . 5 ( range 16–82 ) months . Therefore , this study provides evidence that benzimidazole treatment is parasitocidal in a subset of patients ."
"Although popliteal cysts are most frequently identified in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), they may occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which serious complicated cases such as cyst rupture can be developed. The objective of this study was to report four patients with RA (six knees) in combination with OA with a brief review of literature of previous similar published cases. This is a retrospective review of case records of patients with refractory and/or complicated popliteal cysts, who have successfully treated with arthroscopic intervention. We suggest that arthroscopic interventions such as radical debridement, synovectomy, biomechanical valve excision, and/or cystectomy should be considered in patients with refractory and complicated popliteal cysts associated with RA or RA in combination with OA.","Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a systemic autoimmune condition affecting the synovial membranes of diarthrodial joints . The etiology of RA is unclear but is thought to result from an environmental trigger in the context of genetic predisposition . We report that a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) ( rs231778 ) in CTLA4 , which encodes a negative regulator of T cell activation , is associated ( p = 2 . 4×10−28 ) with protection from developing RA among African Americans . rs231778 is only polymorphic in populations of African ancestry . Protective alleles such as this one may contribute to the purported lower prevalence of RA in African Americans . Our finding appears to be independent from confounding by linkage with the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope or by genetic admixture . Furthermore , we did not replicate associations of CTLA4 SNPs with RA or other autoimmune diseases previously reported in Asians and Caucasians , such as rs3087243 ( +60C/T ) and rs231775 ( +49A/G ) . The associations of different SNPs with RA susceptibility specific to different populations highlight the importance of CTLA4 in the pathogenesis of RA and demonstrate the ethnic-specific genetic background that contributes to its susceptibility ."
"Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage and cyst cavity debridement operation of popliteal cyst in knee osteoarthritis patients. Methods: From August 2007 to March 2013, 58 knee osteoarthritis patients with popliteal cyst were treated with arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage through posteromedial portal and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal. In all patients, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to detect combined intra-articular pathology and the communication between popliteal cyst and knee cavity. Clinical efficacy was evaluated through VAS score and Lysholm score. Results: All patients had neither recurrence of popliteal cyst nor complaints of pain, swelling, or functional impairment at average 24 months follow-up after surgery. Postoperatively, VAS score was decreased significantly and Lysholm score was raised significantly comparing preoperatively. Conclusion: Arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage operation through posteromedial portal and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal is an effective minimally invasive surgery method for the treatment of popliteal cyst without recurrence in knee osteoarthritis patients.",joint inflammation of the right knee .
"There is a lack of research comparing the clinical effects of arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts between the one posteromedial portal (OPP) technique and the two posteromedial portals (TPP) technique. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical efficacy of arthroscopic treatment for popliteal cysts between the 2 techniques. Patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts after surgery were retrospectively invited to participate in this study. They received arthroscopy treatment via the OPP technique or the TPP technique. At the final follow-up, the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria and the Lysholm score were used for clinical evaluation. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to detect the recurrence of cysts postoperatively. Finally, 53 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were included in this study, including 25 in the OPP group and 28 in the TPP group. The operation time of the TPP group was significantly longer than that of the OPP group (P < .001). In the OPP group, the cysts disappeared in 17 patients and reduced in size in 8 patients. In the TPP group, the cysts disappeared in 23 patients and reduced in size in 5 patients. According to the Rauschning and Lindgren classification, the recurrence rate was significantly lower in the TPP group (0%) than in the OPP group (4%) (P = .03). In addition, there was no significant difference in the Lysholm score between the OPP group and the TPP group (P = .77). TPP technique is more effective and superior than OPP technique for the treatment of popliteal cysts.","Cystic echinococcosis ( CE ) is a parasitic infection of worldwide occurrence transmitted to humans by dogs .

"To reduce the damage to posteromedial knee capsule, we developed a direct extra-articular arthroscopic approach for excision of symptomatic popliteal cysts. This study aimed to demonstrate the surgical technique and present the 2-year follow-up results. Cystectomy is performed by extra-articular surgical approach through a high posteromedial portal. Twenty-one consecutive patients diagnosed of symptomatic popliteal cysts with failed initial conservative treatments were included. At a median follow-up of 29.4 months, all knees had improved clinical function assessed by Rauschning and Lindgren knee classification (p<0.001). The cysts were either disappeared (95.2%) or reduced in size (4.8%). Only one (4.8%) patient had recurrent cyst, which was solved after ultrasound-guided aspiration. This direct extra-articular arthroscopic technique could be a feasible alternative for treatment of symptomatic popliteal cysts.","Cystic echinococcosis is a serious public health problem in Tibetan communities of northwest Sichuan Province , China .

"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, reached epidemic proportions. Asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions. There is consensus that a 'window of opportunity' exists during pregnancy and early in life when environmental factors may influence its development. We review multiple environmental, biologic and sociologic factors that may be important in the development of asthma. Meta-analyses of studies have demonstrated that multifaceted interventions are required in order to develop asthma prevention. Multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefits. Asthma represents a dysfunctional interaction with our genes and the environment to which they are exposed, especially in fetal and early infant life. The increasing prevalence of asthma also may be an indication of increased population risk for the development of other chronic non-communicable autoimmune diseases. This review will focus on the factors which may be important in the primary prevention of asthma.

"Purpose of review: The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries. The present review focuses on recent literature regarding asthma prevention in childhood. Recent findings: Several environmental exposures in infancy or early childhood are associated with reduced prevalence of asthma, but the mechanisms leading to these associations remain unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated limited success in the prevention of asthma or asthma symptoms with the use of asthma medications, once the therapy is discontinued. Immunotherapy offers another strategy for asthma prevention, and groups treated with this intervention have demonstrated reduced atopy and asthma. Several multi-interventional trials have demonstrated a reduced asthma symptom burden but have not demonstrated significant differences in objective measures such as lung function or bronchial hyper-responsiveness between intervention groups. Summary: The most promising asthma prevention strategies to date have been those that use a multi-interventional approach employing both dietary and environmental manipulations. More research is needed to assess the long-term follow-up of multi-interventional trials and to evaluate novel intervention strategies in the primary or secondary prevention of asthma in childhood.","Recent genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified genetic variants associated with lung diseases .

Asthma is associated with gene-environment interactions, and there is consensus that a ""window of opportunity"" exists early in life when environmental factors may influence its development.

However, multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefit. We propose that allergic diseases, including asthma, represent a dysfunctional interaction with our environment and that the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergy herald increased population risk for the development of other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

"Purpose of review: This article presents recent findings and perspectives on the relationship between early-life respiratory infections and asthma inception, and discusses emerging concepts on strategies that target these infectious agents for asthma prevention. Recent findings: Cumulative evidence supports the role of early-life viral infections, especially respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus, as major antecedents of childhood asthma. These viruses may have different mechanistic roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. The airway microbiome and virus-bacteria interactions in early life have emerged as additional determinants of childhood asthma. Innovative strategies for the prevention of these early-life infections, or for attenuation of acute infection severity, are being investigated and may identify effective strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of childhood asthma. Summary: Early-life infections are major determinants of asthma development. The pathway from early-life infections to asthma is the result of complex interactions between the specific type of the virus, genetic, and environmental factors. Novel intervention strategies that target these infectious agents have been investigated in proof-of-concepts trials, and further study is necessary to determine their capacity for asthma prevention.",IL-33 is responsible for the immunopathophysiological response observed following neonatal RSV infection in mice .

"It has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy (PAT) study was published, exploring the dream of the allergist: determining whether allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) can alter the natural course of disease and prevent the development of asthma in children with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis.

Actively treated children had significantly fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years, as evaluated by clinical diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.52; P < .05).

"Lower respiratory tract infections by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the foremost cause of infant hospitalization and are implicated in lasting pulmonary impairment and the development of asthma. Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. However, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. In this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against RSV infection. Neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. However, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. Neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. We suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe RSV-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. The antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with RSV-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment.",IL-33 is responsible for the immunopathophysiological response observed following neonatal RSV infection in mice .

"Several risk factors for asthma have been linked with exposures during pregnancy, making their true effects similarly hard to elucidate given the constraints of conducting research in this particular group, and the difficulty of interpreting any findings. A report published in Pediatrics outlined the effects of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of atopic disease (including asthma) in children, reflecting that multiple factors could act in concert to influence disease development. Maternal exposure to vitamin D has been investigated as a risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze, with conflicting findings; several studies have reported that vitamin D could protect against asthma attacks or prevent worsening asthma symptoms. Many studies have investigated such associations with risk of disease, but the reporting in the media of the study findings often leaves much to be desired in terms of nuance and balance.",IL-33 is responsible for the immunopathophysiological response observed following neonatal RSV infection in mice .

"Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) as the main condition for the development of asthma may be modulated either by intrinsic or by extrinsic stimuli as well as by climatic and meteorologic factors. Proinflammatory mediators in combination with alterations of airway mucosa induce or amplify BHR. Upper airway viral infections, exposure to allergens in atopic subjects, chronic hyperplastic changes of the upper airways, airway irritants and analgesics are supposed to be the most likely asthma triggers in predisposed children and adults. There is the suggestion that BHR can be improved not only by treatment with steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs but also by maritime climatotherapy. The latter could be the result not only of the reduction of inhalative irritants, e.g. of allergen concentration, but also by the involvement or more complex mechanisms. Possible theoretic approaches and hypotheses regarding the mode of action of maritime climatic cures are discussed. First preliminary results obtained in a mediterranean region have demonstrated a negative impact of metereologic events like passages of cold weather fronts or increase of wind velocity on the course of asthma disease. An improvement of BHR assessed by histamine challenge test has been observed at the end of climatotherapy in the Baltic sea area. Prospective studies about asthma prevention in subjects at risk with BHR and atopy that have been starting should contribute to the evaluation of the therapeutic effects and the prognostic importance of maritime climatotherapy for getting exact scientific indications for climatotherapy in patients with bronchial asthma.","Infections with schistosomes , such as S . mansoni , S . japonicum and S . haematobium , are considered a major public health concern . Morbidity arises through granulomatous responses to eggs that become trapped in infected tissues . Interestingly , schistosomes belong to the group of helminths that have been shown to reduce allergy or autoimmunity . Indeed , the evidence provided by epidemiological surveys and experimental animal models has been so overwhelming that such helminths are now included in the Hygiene Hypothesis . However , since helminths provoke immunological responses that are similar to those seen in allergy ( increased eosinophilia and IgE ) it is suggested that additional mechanisms dampen such allergic responses . Helminth-induced regulatory T cells ( Treg ) are considered a component of these modulatory networks . Using an allergic airway inflammation model , we have elucidated that schistosome-mediated protection requires patency , that is , active egg production from fecund female worms . In addition , protection was shown to be mediated by infection-induced Treg . Interestingly , in endemic countries it is usually individuals with strong patent infections that show reduced allergic prevalence .

Proinflammatory mediators in combination with alterations of airway mucosa induce or amplify BHR. Upper airway viral infections, exposure to allergens in atopic subjects, chronic hyperplastic changes of the upper airways, airway irritants and analgesics are supposed to be the most likely asthma triggers in predisposed children and adults. There is the suggestion that BHR can be improved not only by treatment with steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs but also by maritime climatotherapy. The latter could be the result not only of the reduction of inhalative irritants, e.g. of allergen concentration, but also by the involvement or more complex mechanisms. Possible theoretic approaches and hypotheses regarding the mode of action of maritime climatic cures are discussed. First preliminary results obtained in a mediterranean region have demonstrated a negative impact of metereologic events like passages of cold weather fronts or increase of wind velocity on the course of asthma disease. An improvement of BHR assessed by histamine challenge test has been observed at the end of climatotherapy in the Baltic sea area. Prospective studies about asthma prevention in subjects at risk with BHR and atopy that have been starting should contribute to the evaluation of the therapeutic effects and the prognostic importance of maritime climatotherapy for getting exact scientific indications for climatotherapy in patients with bronchial asthma.","Infections with schistosomes , such as S . mansoni , S . japonicum and S . haematobium , are considered a major public health concern . Morbidity arises through granulomatous responses to eggs that become trapped in infected tissues . Interestingly , schistosomes belong to the group of helminths that have been shown to reduce allergy or autoimmunity . Indeed , the evidence provided by epidemiological surveys and experimental animal models has been so overwhelming that such helminths are now included in the Hygiene Hypothesis . However , since helminths provoke immunological responses that are similar to those seen in allergy ( increased eosinophilia and IgE ) it is suggested that additional mechanisms dampen such allergic responses . Helminth-induced regulatory T cells ( Treg ) are considered a component of these modulatory networks . Using an allergic airway inflammation model , we have elucidated that schistosome-mediated protection requires patency , that is , active egg production from fecund female worms . In addition , protection was shown to be mediated by infection-induced Treg . Interestingly , in endemic countries it is usually individuals with strong patent infections that show reduced allergic prevalence . Thus , further research into the immunomodulatory capacity of schistosome-egg derived factors may elucidate novel drug candidates or enhance treatment strategies to reduce allergic responses on the cellular level ."
"With the exception, perhaps, of measures for the avoidance of infrequent forms of asthma caused by very specific types of exposure (e.g., occupational or aspirin-induced asthma), no single action has been irrefutably demonstrated to decrease the risk of the development of persistent asthma in persons who do not already have the disease.",Please email the Early Years FEL Census Team for a username and password for the Anycomms system.
"The National Disease Management Program (NDM Program) represents the basic content of structured, cross-sectoral healthcare. In particular, the NDM Program is directed towards coordinating different disciplines and areas of healthcare. The recommendations are developed through interdisciplinary consensus of the scientific medical societies on the basis of the best available evidence. Within this scope the scientific medical societies concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, therapy and rehabilitation of asthma consented upon a National Disease Management Guideline for Asthma in 2005. Among other things, the following cornerstones of asthma prevention were agreed upon: Breastfeeding and non-smoking were suggested as primary prevention measures for (expectant) parents. With respect to secondary prevention, recommendations have been made for allergen avoidance, active/passive smoking and immunotherapy. Regarding tertiary prevention, position statements on vaccination and specific immunotherapy are developed. The present paper presents both the original texts of the recommendations and the evidence underlying them.",The hard-to-understand specifics of the scientific paper could only be grasped by a handful of experts.
"Corticosteroids have been used for decades to modulate inflammation therapeutically, yet there is a paucity of data on their effects in humans. We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or ""immunome"", in healthy humans after systemic corticosteroid administration. We used multiplexed techniques to query the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline, and after intravenous hydrocortisone (HC) administered at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses, to provide insight into how corticosteroids exert their effects. We performed comprehensive phenotyping of 120 lymphocyte subsets by high dimensional flow cytometry, and observed a decline in circulating specific B and T cell subsets, which reached their nadir 4-8 hours after administration of HC. However, B and T cells rebounded above baseline 24 hours after HC infusion, while NK cell numbers remained stable. Whole transcriptome profiling revealed down regulation of NF-κB signaling, apoptosis, and cell death signaling transcripts that preceded lymphocyte population changes, with activation of NK cell and glucocorticoid receptor signaling transcripts. Our study is the first to systematically characterize the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome, and we demonstrate that HC exerts differential effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. Fauci et al. reported that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of HC cause a transient nadir in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes at 4–6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. Our data are consistent with these observations. We also observed differential effects of the two steroid doses on lymphocyte recovery at 24 hours, with total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells rebounding above baseline after the 250 mg dose and total NK cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. HC induced a rapid decline in circulating monocytes and mRNAs related to innate immune signaling as early as one hour after infusion. These effects preceded neutrophil demargination and lymphocyte depletion.","Natural killer ( NK ) cells are an important cellular defense against viral pathogens , and are regulated in part by interactions between killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( KIRs ) on NK cells and MHC class I ligands on target cells .

"Lymphocyte kinetic studies employing 51-chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes were performed in nine normal volunteers in order to determine the effects of hydrocortisone administration on the recirculating versus the nonrecirculating intravascular lymphocyte pools. Following infusion of labeled cells, the recirculating portion of the labeled cells rapidly equilibrated with the total intravascular lymphocyte pool and the vastly larger total-body recirculating lymphocyte pool, so that by 1 hr following infusion 21.8% plus or minus 3.2% of the labeled lymphocytes were left in the circulation. Four hundred milligrams of intravenous hydrocortisone administered 24 hr after infusion of labeled cells caused a profound but transient lymphocytopenia which was maximal at 4 hr with return of lymphocyte counts to normal by 24 hr after injection. Concomitant with the lymphocytopenia there was a dramatic increase in lymphocyte specific activity (cpm per 10-6 lymphocytes), while the total lymphocyte-associated radioactivity remaining in the circulation was unchanged, indicating that corticosteroid administration depleted the unlabeled recirculating cells. As the lymphocyte counts returned to normal following hydrocortisone, the specific activity also returned to normal. These studies indicated that hydrocortisone administration caused a transient lymphocytopenia by a preferential depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocyte pool.","African trypanosomes are motile parasites that cause sleeping sickness . They multiply first in the blood then cause death mainly by effects on the brain: immune system cells , including T cells and dendritic cells , play major roles in this . Thinking we might see the attack on the brain , we infected mice with trypanosomes and used a two-photon microscope , which allowed us to image the superficial brain and the delicate tissue between the skull and the brain called the meninges without making a hole in the skull . The mice ( which were anesthetized ) had been genetically modified so that T cells and dendritic cells were fluorescent , as were the trypanosomes . We did not notice much happening in the brain itself , but in the meninges , in a compartment called the dura , huge numbers of T cells and dendritic cells appeared . Trypanosomes also moved from the blood into this compartment . Since T cells , dendritic cells and trypanosomes had not been videoed in the meninges before , we began by observing them carefully: their numbers , their movements and their interactions . The accumulation of lymphocytes is a sign of meningitis , a feature of infection by a wide range of pathogens and our results suggest interesting future work ."
"The mechanisms and kinetics of the immunosuppressive effects of alternate-day prednisone were investigated in a group of patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases receiving a range of alternate-day prednisone doses from 5 to 120 mg. Total circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations defined both by surface markers and by in vitro functional capacities, were studied. At 8 a. m. of the day on prednisone, just before drug administration, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses to various mitogenic and antigenic stimuli were normal. 4 h after the administration of prednisone, there was a profound lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia, with a differential depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes as well as various functionally defined lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte kinetic studies using a radioactive chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes showed that the lymphocytopenia was due predominantly to a transient depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocytepool. All these parameters returned to normal by 8 a.m. of the following day (off prednisone) and remained normal throughout the day. This very transient lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers, proportions, and functions throughout the remainder of the 2-day cycle, was associated with suppression of disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in these patients nor increase the likelihood of infectious complications. This drug-associated cyclic and transient monocytopenia and selective lymphocytopenia is best explained by a redistribution of recirculating lymphocytes to other body compartments, particularly the bone marrow.",the remainer of her body hasd no problems
"The growth of knowledge in the field of the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone/prednisone has been slow for several reasons. First, convenient and specific methods for measuring these steroids only became available with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods. Secondly, prednisolone is nonlinearly bound to transcortin and albumin: since the unbound concentrations of prednisolone are biologically relevant, it was necessary to determine the free fraction in each plasma sample. Thirdly, due to the short half-life of prednisolone no steady-state is achieved, and therefore area under the concentration-time curve needed to be determined in all studies. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interconvertible and prednisolone is given intravenously as an ester prodrug, features which created controversies about the correct interpretation of pharmacokinetic results. Finally, the total body clearances of total and (to a lesser degree) of unbound prednisolone increase with increasing concentrations of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results between different subjects, standardised doses had to be administered. The investigations performed so far have revealed that: (1) the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics partly explain the clinical observation that an alternate-day regimen with prednisone yields fewer biological effects; (2) the interconversion of prednisone into prednisolone is not a limiting factor, even in patients with severely impaired liver function; (3) hypoproteinaemia per se does not cause increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone in vivo; (4) patients with liver failure, renal failure or a renal transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing oral contraceptive steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole have increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone-whereas hyperthyroid patients, some patients with Crohn's disease, subjects taking microsomal liver enzyme-inducing agents or patients on intravenous prednisolone phthalate (instead of prednisolone phosphate) or on some brands of enteric coated prednisolone tablets have decreased concentrations of prednisolone.

"Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous prednisolone. Plasma and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone were determined by HPLC, and the binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was measured by radioisotopic and equilibrium dialysis techniques. The pharmacokinetics of both oral prednisone and intravenous prednisolone were dose-dependent. The mean oral dose plasma clearances of prednisone ranged from 572 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 5 mg dose to 2271 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 50 mg dose. Changes in prednisone half-life were insignificant, but increases in the half-life of its metabolite were dose-dependent. The systemic plasma clearance of i.v. prednisolone was dose-dependent and increased from 111 to 194 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 5 to 40 mg i.v. dosage range. The steady-state volume of distribution also increased, but little change in mean transit time and half-life was found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was markedly concentration-dependent, and a two compartment, nonlinear equation was used to characterize the effective binding of prednisolone to transcortin and albumin. The apparent pharmacokinetic parameters of protein-free and transcortin-free prednisolone were relatively constant with dose. The interconversion of prednisone and prednisolone varied with time and dose, although prednisolone concentrations dominated by 4- to 10-fold over prednisone. In urine, 2-5% of either administered drug was excreted as prednisone and 11-24% as prednisolone. The apparent renal clearances of both steroids were also nonlinear and unrelated to protein binding. These studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics of prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that protein binding does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and disposition.","Dengue is an acute , mosquito-borne febrile illness and around 390 million cases occur annually in more than 100 countries .

"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), nocturnal release of proinflammatory cytokines is not adequately counteracted by endogenous glucocorticoid and is associated with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. Taking exogenous glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the conventional time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. Modified-release prednisone tablets were developed to allow administration at bedtime for programmed delivery of glucocorticoid during the night. Single-center crossover studies were conducted, each in ≤24 healthy subjects, to compare the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg oral dose of modified-release prednisone and conventional prednisone, as well as the effect of food on bioavailability. There was no substantial difference in pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulations apart from the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets (C(max) 97%, AUC(0-∞) 101%, 90% confidence intervals within the requisite range for bioequivalence). Administration after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but bioavailability was reduced under fasted conditions. Pharmacokinetic evaluation in 9 patients with RA confirmed that modified-release prednisone tablets taken at bedtime (around 22:00 h) with or after an evening meal result in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after intake.","This paper describes the use of a modeling and simulation approach to explore a reported pharmacokinetic interaction between two drugs ( ivermectin and azithromycin ) , which along with albendazole , are being developed for combination use in neglected tropical diseases . This approach is complementary to more traditional pharmacokinetic and safety studies that need to be conducted to support combined use of different health interventions . A mathematical model of ivermectin pharmacokinetics was created and used to simulate multiple trials , and the probability of certain outcomes ( very high peak blood ivermectin levels when given in combination ) was determined . All simulated peak blood levels were within ranges known to be safe and well tolerated . Additional field studies are needed to confirm these findings ."
"Background: Renal transplant recipients were noted to appear cushingoid while on low doses of steroid as part of a triple therapy immunosuppression of cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine. Methods: The study group comprised adult renal transplant recipients with stable graft function who had received their renal allograft a minimum of 1 year previously (43 studies undertaken in 22 men and 20 women) with median daily prednisone dose of 7 mg (range 3-10). The control group was healthy nontransplant subjects [median dose 10 mg (10-30)]. Prednisolone bioavailability was measured using a limited 6-hour area under the curve (AUC), with prednisolone measured using specific HPLC assay. Results: The median prednisolone AUC/mg dose for all transplant recipients was significantly greater than the control group by approximately 50% (316 nmol x h/L/mg prednisolone versus 218). AUC was significantly higher in female recipients (median 415 versus 297 for men) and in recipients receiving cyclosporin (348 versus 285). The highest AUC was in women on estrogen supplements who were receiving cyclosporin (median 595). A significantly higher proportion of patients on triple therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (17/27 versus 4/15), more women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22), and the AUC/mg prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without (median 377 versus 288 nmol x h/L/mg). Discussion: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that CsA increases the bioavailability of prednisolone, most likely through inhibition of P-glycoprotein. The increased exposure to steroid increased the side-effect profile of steroids in the majority of patients. Because the major contributor to AUC is the maximum postdose concentration, it may be possible to use single-point monitoring (2 hours postdose) for routine clinical studies.","Dengue is an acute , mosquito-borne febrile illness and around 390 million cases occur annually in more than 100 countries .

"The effects of single oral doses of 10, 15, or 30 mg of prednisone on circulating mononuclear cells, autologous MLR, mitogen responses, and allogeneic MLR were studied in healthy volunteers. Doses as low as 10 mg were immunosuppressive, causing diminution of circulating T cells and monocytes, and significant reduction in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. These effects were maximal 6 hr after drug administration and gone by 24 hr. Autologous MLR responses were particularly sensitive to the effects of prednisone being significantly and consistently suppressed 2 hr after drug administration, before significant cell redistribution had occurred. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells were more easily suppressed than responding T cells. Since the autologous MLR may be important in in vivo regulation of immune responses, its reduction by low-dose glucocorticoids may be of clinical relevance. This suppressive effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy.","Intestinal schistosomiasis is a parasitic water borne neglected tropical disease of considerable public health relevance in the tropics and subtropics .

"The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of corticosteroids on Th1 and Th2 serum cytokine balance in patients with GO: IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10. Further, we tested the hypothesis of an up-regulation of Th2 immune response during successful treatment with corticosteroids to explain their beneficial effect in Graves' ophthalmopathy. Serum cytokines were detected in three groups of subjects: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmopathy (Gd), 16 patients with clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy (GO) (CAS over 3 points, last consultation record for GO less than a year old) and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous infusions of methylprednisolone (MP) (2 series, 3 g each time) and subsequent treatment with oral prednisone (60 mg per day) in a tapering schedule. The serum samples were collected 24 hours before MP, 24 hours after MP, 14 days of treatment with prednisone and at the end of corticosteroid therapy. The levels of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-4 and IL-10 in the serum were determined using ELISA. Statistical significance was estimated by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Our findings show a deviation to systemic Th2 profile cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with GO, we found a significantly increased serum IL-10 concentration. In corticosteroid-responsive patients, the balance of serum cytokines IL-4/IFNgamma, IL-4/TNFalpha, IL-10/IFNgamma and IL-10/TN Falpha increased and remained upregulated until the end of the study. In non-responders, the balance of serum cytokines studied increased after methylprednisolone but declined markedly during continuation of the therapy with prednisone. In summary, our results show that efficient corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 profile cytokine balance. The upregulation of serum IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids indicate the possibility of using these cytokines as predictors of the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.","Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the clinical forms of Chagas' disease ( CD ) after the infection caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . Even though strategies adopted in most Latin-American countries in the last decades towards vector control have been effective in reducing the incidence of CD , active transmission is maintained in some regions , and secondary prevention approaches are still required for the infected patients , mostly because the specific anti-parasitic medications are toxic and perhaps of limited efficacy in chronically infected individuals . Moreover , there are no markers to predict the risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy in asymptomatic , chronically infected patients , although the failure in the mechanisms that control the immune response can be involved in the development of Chagas' heart disease . In this study we show that preserved activity of regulatory T cells and the production of the cytokine IL-17 are connected with a more benign evolution of the disease , which brings a new understanding on the mechanisms associated with progression of CD ."
"It is thought that glucocorticosteroids impair the clearance of immune complexes by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). We studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (1 mg/kg body weight per day) on MPS function in 10 healthy volunteers, using soluble radiolabeled aggregates of human immunoglobulin G as a probe. MPS function was assessed before steroid treatment, and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. Elimination kinetics and the uptake of the immunoglobulin aggregates by liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment. This suggests that, in contrast to general belief, high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, acute effect on MPS function.","Intestinal schistosomiasis is a parasitic water borne neglected tropical disease of considerable public health relevance in the tropics and subtropics . In Uganda , approximately 20 million people are at risk of being infected with S . mansoni , which causes intestinal schistosomiasis , and 4 million individuals are estimated to be infected . Currently , schistosomiasis control using PZQ chemotherapy is mainly focusing on school-age children ( age 6–19 years ) and to those adults considered to have the highest risk of infection . So far preschool-age children are not targeted in schistosomiasis preventive chemotherapy campaigns due to the limited documentation on the safety of PZQ in this age group . However , a number of studies have revealed that children less than 6 years of age get infected with S . mansoni usually through bathing , playing or swimming in schistosome-infested waters and are at higher risk of infection than previously thought . This study compared efficacy of PZQ treatment in terms of CRs and ERRs using a single and double dose among children aged 1–5 years , living along Lake Victoria in eastern Uganda . The effect of the two different regimes on S . mansoni re-infection 8 months post treatment was also assessed ."
"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the Folliculin gene and is characterized by the formation of fibrofolliculomas, early onset renal cancers, pulmonary cysts, and spontaneous pneumothoraces. The exact pathogenesis of tumor and lung cyst formation in BHD remains unclear. There is great phenotypic variability in the clinical features of BHD, and patients can present with any combination of skin, pulmonary, or renal findings.

"Background and objective: The purpose of this study was to create a practical CT-based algorithm to differentiate Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome from other diffuse cystic lung diseases (DCLD). Methods: The study was a retrospective review of the CT images of 33 patients with BHD syndrome, 33 patients with LAM, and 23 patients with NBNL (non-BHD and non-LAM) among DCLD patients. On the basis of the data collected, the CT images were reviewed again to evaluate the characteristics (size, number, distribution, and morphology) of pulmonary cysts. Results: Lower lung-predominant cysts were more likely to be found in patients with BHD syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the NBNL DCLD group. In the axial distribution, 18 of 33 patients in BHD group had cysts that were predominantly near the mediastinum, and all the patients in the LAM and NBNL DCLD groups had diffuse cysts. The appearance of fusiform cysts was more easily observed in patients in the BHD group. In total, 58% patients in the BHD group had less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-BHD group had more than 50 lung cysts. The biggest cyst was located in the lower lobe in 28 of 33 patients in the BHD group, while 11 of 33 patients in LAM group and 10 patients in the NBNL DCLD group had the biggest cyst in the lower lobe. Conclusion: The pulmonary cysts in patients with BHD tended to be fusiform, less numerous and located predominantly in the lower lobe and near the mediastinum. These radiologic pulmonary features could assist physicians in differentiating BHD from other DCLDs.",the scope for seeing into the lung was moved into each area of the left lung.
"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised clinically by skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal cancer. The condition is caused by germline mutations in the FLCN gene, which encodes folliculin; the function of this protein is largely unknown, although FLCN has been linked to the mTOR pathway. The availability of DNA-based diagnosis has allowed insight into the great variation in expression of FLCN, both within and between families. Patients can present with skin signs and also with pneumothorax or renal cancer. Preventive measures are aimed mainly at early diagnosis and treatment of renal cancer. This Review gives an overview of current diagnosis and management of BHD.","The development of a functional nervous system requires that nerve cells are generated at exactly the right time and place to be correctly integrated .

"Germline mutations in the novel tumor suppressor gene FLCN are responsible for the autosomal dominant inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome that predisposes to fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax, and an increased risk for developing kidney tumors. Although the encoded protein, folliculin (FLCN), has no sequence homology to known functional domains, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the C-terminus of FLCN has structural similarity to DENN (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain proteins that act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small Rab GTPases. FLCN forms a complex with folliculin interacting proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This review summarizes FLCN functional studies which support a role for FLCN in diverse metabolic pathways and cellular processes that include modulation of the mTOR pathway, regulation of PGC1α and mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion and RhoA signaling, control of TFE3/TFEB transcriptional activity, amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 on lysosomes through Rag GTPases, and regulation of autophagy. Ongoing research efforts are focused on clarifying the primary FLCN-associated pathway(s) that drives the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and kidney tumors in BHD patients carrying germline FLCN mutations.","The development of a functional nervous system requires that nerve cells are generated at exactly the right time and place to be correctly integrated .

"Objective: Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome involving multiple organs. In young patients, renal neoplasms that are multiple, bilateral, or both, such as oncocytomas, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hybrid chromophobe RCC-oncocytomas, clear cell RCC, and papillary RCC, can suggest BHD syndrome. Extrarenal findings, including dermal lesions, pulmonary cysts, and spontaneous pneumothoraces, also aid in diagnosis. Conclusion: Radiologists may be one of the first medical specialists to suggest the diagnosis of BHD syndrome. Knowledge of pathogenesis and management, including the importance of the types of renal neoplasms in a given patient, is needed to properly recognize this rare condition.","Children with cartilage tumor syndromes form multiple tumors of cartilage next to joints .

"Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene (FLCN) on chromosome 17p cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD), which is associated with cystic lung disease. The risk of lung collapse (pneumothorax) in BHD patients is 50-fold higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in BHD is distinctive because the cysts tend to be basilar, subpleural and lentiform, differentiating BHD from most other cystic lung diseases. Recently, major advances in elucidating the primary functions of the folliculin protein have been made, including roles in mTOR and AMPK signaling via the interaction of FLCN with FNIP1/2, and cell-cell adhesion via the physical interaction of FLCN with plakophilin 4 (PKP4), an armadillo-repeat containing protein that interacts with E-cadherin and is a component of the adherens junctions. In addition, in just the last three years, the pulmonary impact of FLCN deficiency has been examined for the first time. In mouse models, evidence has emerged that AMPK signaling and cell-cell adhesion are involved in alveolar enlargement. In addition, the pathologic features of human BHD cysts have been recently comprehensively characterized. The ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in BHD arise because of fundamental defects in cell-cell adhesion, leading to repeated respiration-induced physical stretch-induced stress and, over time, expansion of alveolar spaces particularly in regions of the lung with larger changes in alveolar volume and at weaker ""anchor points"" to the pleura. This hypothesis ties together many of the new data from cellular and mouse models of BHD and from the human pathologic studies. Critical questions remain. These include whether the consequences of stretch-induced cyst formation arise through a destructive/inflammatory program or a proliferative program (or both), whether cyst initiation involves a ""second hit"" genetic event inactivating the remaining wild-type copy of FLCN (as is known to occur in BHD-associated renal cell carcinomas), and whether cyst initiation involves exclusively the epithelial compartment versus an interaction between the epithelium and mesenchyme. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms of cystic lung disease in BHD may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with more than 20,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone.","In 2002 , a new human coronavirus ( CoV ) , termed SARS-CoV , emerged in southern China from coronaviruses circulating within live animals sold for food . Due to the ease and speed of human global travel , this new respiratory virus rapidly spread worldwide , illustrating the need to better understand how these viruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection . SARS-CoV infection of the human lower respiratory tract caused an atypical pneumonia characterized by viral replication in lung tissue and lung inflammation visible by chest X-ray . To identify how the immune system responds to and provides protection from SARS-CoV infection , we have developed a mouse model that mimics many aspects of SARS-CoV disease in humans . Utilizing this mouse model , we discovered that a host gene , termed MyD88 , is required to control SARS-CoV replication and spread in lung tissue and for protection from death . In addition , MyD88-dependent functions were required for early immune and inflammatory responses in the lung following SARS-CoV infection , and the absence of these early responses correlated with severe SARS-CoV-induced disease and death . Our studies identify host immune responses that provide protection from SARS-CoV infection and provide valuable insight toward the development of successful antiviral therapies ."
"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene FLCN, encoding the protein folliculin. Its clinical expression typically includes multiple pulmonary cysts, recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces, cutaneous fibrofolliculomas and renal tumours of various histological types. BHD has no sex predilection and tends to manifest in the third or fourth decade of life. Multiple bilateral pulmonary cysts are found on chest computed tomography in >80% of patients and more than half experience one or more episodes of pneumothorax. A family history of pneumothorax is an important clue, which suggests the diagnosis of BHD. Unlike other cystic lung diseases such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, BHD does not lead to progressive loss of lung function and chronic respiratory insufficiency. Renal tumours affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime, and can be multiple and recurrent. The diagnosis of BHD is based on a combination of genetic, clinical and/or skin histopathological criteria. Management mainly consists of early pleurodesis in the case of pneumothorax, periodic renal imaging for tumour detection, and diagnostic work-up in search of BHD in relatives of the index patient.","Many researchers consider the Sudan as the mycetoma homeland .

"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterised by pulmonary cysts, fibrofolliculomas and renal tumours. The pulmonary cysts may lead to pneumothorax, and in cases of primary, spontaneous pneumothorax the syndrome should be excluded. The renal tumours are frequently malignant, but slow-growing. Screening and family assessment enable discovery of renal cancer at an early stage. The syndrome is underdiagnosed and little known.","Loxosceles ( recluse or brown spider ) is the most important spider genus causing human envenomation . In Brazil Loxosceles spiders were responsible for approximately 7 , 000 cases of spider envenomation per year .

Even patients with mild cutaneous lesion may develop severe hemolysis and AKI , which is the main cause of death after these accidents . The mechanisms causing kidney injury are poorly understood . In this manuscript we described a consistent rodent model of Loxosceles gaucho venom-induced AKI and studied some of the possible mechanisms of the renal lesion . The results of this research showed that kidney injury may occur independently of the cutaneous lesion and without changes in the systemic blood pressure .

"Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in Folliculin gene (FLCN). BHD is characterized by lower lobe-predominant pulmonary cysts with risk of pneumothorax, benign skin tumors (fibrofolliculomas), and renal cell carcinoma, often of an unusual chromophobe/oncocytic hybrid histology. The FLCN protein functions in multiple signaling and metabolic pathways including positive regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity via FLCN's GTPase (GAP) activity for Rag C, positive regulation of Wnt signaling (in mesenchymal cells), and negative regulation of TFE3 nuclear localization. Therefore, FLCN-deficient cells are predicted to have reduced mTORC1 and Wnt activity and enhanced TFE3 activity. Folliculin also has functions in autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, 5' AMP activated protein kinase activity, and other pathways. The specific contributions of these pathways to the lung manifestations of BHD are largely unknown. This review is focused on the pulmonary manifestations of BHD, highlighting selected recent advances in elucidating the cellular functions of FLCN and current hypotheses related to the pathogenesis of cystic lung disease in BHD, including the ""stretch hypothesis."" We also discuss important knowledge gaps in the field, including the genetic, cellular and physical mechanisms of cyst pathogenesis, and the timing of cyst initiation, which may occur during lung development.","Although signal transduction pathways are often described as “on–off” systems , the more quantitative aspects of signalling are likely to represent a very important means of regulation of the downstream biological outcomes . Mutations in members of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway represent among the most common defects in human cancers . However , it is yet unclear which factors determine tissue and organ specificity of the tumours arising upon Wnt constitutive activation . Previously , we have generated a series of hypomorphic alleles at the Apc tumor suppressor gene and showed that the differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells is dependent on the dosage of Wnt/β-catenin signalling these mutants encode for . Likewise , analysis of the two mutational hits occurring at the Apc gene in human and mouse intestinal tumors showed that these are selected to retain specific residual dosages of β-catenin downregulation . Here , we provide further support for this “just-right” signalling model by targeting a germline Apc mutation encoding for very low levels of Wnt signalling activation when compared with other mutants known to trigger intestinal tumorigenesis . Notwithstanding the constitutive nature of this mutation , heterozygous mice show a remarkable and highly penetrant predisposition to multifocal and metastatic mammary cancers without the GI tract tumor phenotype characteristic of the majority of Apc mouse models ."
"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of hair follicle tumors, renal tumors and pulmonary cysts. BHD is caused by heterozygous, predominantly truncating mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene located on chromosome 17, which encodes a highly conserved tumor suppressor protein. Although management of renal tumors of low malignant potential is the primary focus of longitudinal care, pulmonary manifestations including cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothorax are among the most common manifestations in BHD. Due to the lack of awareness, there is commonly a delay in the pulmonary diagnosis of BHD and patients are frequently mislabeled as having chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema or common bullae/blebs. A family history of pneumothorax is present in 35 % of patients with BHD. Certain imaging characteristics of the cysts, including size, basilar and peripheral predominance, perivascular and periseptal localization, and elliptical or lentiform shape can suggest the diagnosis of BHD based on inspection of the chest CT scan alone. Recurrent pneumothoraces are common and early pleurodesis is recommended.

"Background: Nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear. Study design and methods: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies. Results: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors.","Novel detection and sequencing technologies have greatly improved our knowledge of virus diversity in nature .

"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) collection began in two Brazilian hospitals for treatment of severe/critical patients. Methods and materials: Mild/moderate COVID-19 convalescents were selected as CCP donors after reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and absence of symptoms for ≥14 days plus (a) age (18-60 years), body weight greater than 55 kg; (b) immunohematological studies; (c) no infectious markers of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus-1/2, Chagas and syphilis infection; (d) no HLA antibodies (multiparous); (e) second RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab and/or blood) negativity; (f) virus neutralization test (cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test neutralizing antibody) and anti-nucleocapsid protein SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Among 271 donors (41 females, 230 males), 250 presented with neutralizing antibodies. Final RT-PCR was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%; P = .46). Final definition of RT-PCR was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) RT-PCR -ve, and 25/69 RT-PCR +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). Neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. Correlation between IgG signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. Combination of final RT-PCR -ve with neutralizing antibody ≥160 was 41.3% (112/271). Serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and IgA levels (P < .05), probably denoting a ""golden period"" for CCP collection (≤28 days after joining the program); IgA might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. Donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and IgG and IgM levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer. Conclusions: RT-PCR +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody.","Novel detection and sequencing technologies have greatly improved our knowledge of virus diversity in nature .

"Background: Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays are used to test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset. Aim: To determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type. Methods: We used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. Results: The probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests. Conclusion: NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive. This has implications for identifying infected patients, contact tracing and discharging convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","Despite being preventable with adequate biologicals , rabies still causes an estimated 60 , 000 human deaths annually .

"In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one potential cause of concern is that some discharged COVID-19 patients are testing positive again for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. To better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from COVID-19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals.","Novel detection and sequencing technologies have greatly improved our knowledge of virus diversity in nature .

"Many studies have shown that re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in recovered COVID-19 patients are very common. We aim to conduct this review to summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital. The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA before discharge. Further studies should be conducted to develop novel assays that target a crucial region of the RNA genome in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity.","Novel detection and sequencing technologies have greatly improved our knowledge of virus diversity in nature .

"Diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) cases is based on the count of real-time reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive people. Viral load by real-time RT-PCR has been suggested as a biomarker of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. Nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt ) formula between ORF1ab viral and RNase P housekeeping genes. Absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. Most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). Hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads ( 2−ΔΔCt range, 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]). During the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first 2 days postinfection with a sharp decline thereafter.

"Knowledge of the sensitivities of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody tests beyond 35 days after the clinical onset of COVID-19 is insufficient. We aimed to describe positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA)), four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were ≥95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs ≥ 95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were ≥95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. An orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.","Novel detection and sequencing technologies have greatly improved our knowledge of virus diversity in nature .

"The number of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised regarding their performance characteristics, depending on the disease severity and the time of the analysis post-symptom onset (PSO). Thus, independent validations using an unbiased sample selection are required for meaningful serology data interpretation. We aimed to assess the clinical performance of six commercially available assays, the seroconversion, and the dynamics of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included 528 serum samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to six months PSO and 161 serum samples from healthy people. The IgG/total antibodies positive percentage increased and remained above 95% after six months when chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) IgG antiS1/S2 and electro-chemiluminescent assay (ECLIA) total antiNP were used. At early time points PSO, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) IgM antiS achieved the best sensitivity. IgM and IgG appear simultaneously in most circumstances, and when performed in parallel the sensitivity increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms were significantly associated with higher seropositivity percentage and antibody levels. High specificity was found in all evaluated assays, but the sensitivity was variable depending on the time PSO, severity of disease, detection method and targeted antigen.","Despite being preventable with adequate biologicals , rabies still causes an estimated 60 , 000 human deaths annually .

This largely determines the search for new, improved methods of stone fragmentation avoiding small stone fragments and dissemination of the pelvicalyceal system of the kidney with stone-associated infection. The authors have developed a method for controlled stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect at the optical fiber end. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of controlled urinary stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a highly heated distal end of the optical fiber light guide as a method of preventing inflammatory infections in clinical practice. Materials and methods: We analyzed 1666 case histories of urolithiasis patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/ nephrolithoextraction and contact ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction, we also performed a prospective analysis of complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification in 90 patients who underwent fine fragmentation of stones with various lithotripters: ultrasonic, pneumatic, and holmium laser. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect was tested on postoperative samples of 26 renal calculi. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the bladder cavity (n=10). Results: In the percutaneous nephrolithotripsy group, postoperative infectious and inflammatory complications occurred in 34.1% of cases, in the percutaneous nephrolithoextraction group - in 24.6%, in the contact ureterolithotripsy group - in 7.8%, in the ureterolithoextraction group - in 2.5%. The analysis made it possible to identify factors promoting the development of infectious and inflammatory complications. For the first time in clinical practice, there were successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. Controlled coarse fragmentation of stones providing the possibility to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications was performed in the bladder as a model for testing the method. Conclusion: The method of laser-induced controlled coarse fragmentation of stones with a hot-spot effect, developed and tested in clinical practice, is promising for the prevention of infectious and inflammatory complications in patients with potentially infected stones since their fine fragmentation and, consequently, spread of stone-associated toxins and microflora within the urinary system is avoided.",spreading cancer of the bladder

"Introduction: We determine the effect of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index BMI) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) by non-contrast computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT-KUB) in predicting the success of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in the treatment of kidney and ureteric stones. We present this study to further enrich the knowledge of physicians towards the effect of different patient characteristics upon predicting extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy success rates. Methods: We evaluated 155 patients who received ESWL for renal and ureteric stone measuring 3-20 mm (mm), over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters, density in Hounsfield units (HU) and its location was determined on pre-treatment CT-KUB. ESWL was successful if post-treatment residual renal stone fragments were ≤3 mm and for ureteric stones should be totally cleared. Results: The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There was no significant difference seen when the effect of patients age, sex and BMI were studied with ESWL outcome with P values were 0.155, 0.101 and 0.415 respectively. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter has no statistically significant effect on ESWL response rate. while stone density and size determined on CT KUB have statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL with a P-value of 0.002 and 0.000 respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that determination of stone density and stone size on CT KUB pre ESWL can help to predict the outcome of ESWL. We propose that stone density <500 HU and stone size < 5 mm are highly likely to result in successful ESWL.","Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a deadly parasitic disease , transmitted by the sand fly species Phlebotomus argentipes in the Indian sub-continent . Humans are the only proven reservoir of the parasite , Leishmania donovani . Effective vector control is highly desirable to reduce vector density and human and vector contact in the endemic communities to stop the disease transmission . We evaluated the effect of long lasting insecticide treated bed nets ( LLIN ) and bed nets impregnated with slow-release insecticide tablet K-O TAB 1-2-3 ( jointly insecticide-treated nets or ITN ) on VL incidence in a highly endemic sub-district ( upazila ) in Bangladesh . The nets were either donated or impregnated between 2004 to 2008 under three studies and defined as “exposed cohort” comparing their effect on VL incidence with “non-exposed cohort” ( no donation of impregnated nets ) for a 3 year period before and after the intervention . The study identified 1011 VL cases ( IR 140 . 47/10 , 000 per year [py] ) before the intervention , of which 534 and 477 cases in the intervention and control areas respectively . There was a strong and significant overall effect of the ITN intervention , δ = –67 . 45 , p <0 . 0001 . The VL incidence rate was significantly lower in the ITN intervention cohort compared to control in Bangladesh , though some bias cannot be totally ruled out ."
"Introduction: Although spinal anesthesia (SA) may reduce postoperative morbidity, most urologists perform flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) under general anesthesia (GA). The objective of our study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS performed under exclusive SA. Methods: We analyzed all consecutive fURS performed under SA to treat renal stones from March 2011 to February 2017. Details of technique, operative time, outcomes, need for further treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated. Results: Two hundred thirty-four fURS under SA were considered. SA was performed through L2-L3 vertebral interspace in 64.1%. Patients were discharged the same day of surgery. Mean stone burden was 13.5 ± 6.6 mm and mean operative time 76.9 ± 34.6 min. Single-procedure SFR was 69.7%. Further treatments were performed in 22.8%. 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. No Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIb complications were noticed. 99.6% of patients were satisfied with SA. No cases of conversion from SA to GA occurred. Conclusion: fURS can be performed safely and efficiently under SA, taking into account a few details of the technique. Patients' satisfaction with SA is very high, and complications are rare. Although SA is usually adopted in unfit patients for GA, it may be considered as a viable alternative in fit patients.","Trachoma is the most common infectious cause of blindness worldwide .

"The mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) has become a versatile tool to remove kidney stones >2 cm, lower pole stones >1 cm, renal stones previously unresponsive to shockwave therapy or inaccessible by ureteroscopy (within a caliceal diverticulum), stones within complex urinary tracts (urinary diversions, transplanted kidney, and horseshoe kidneys), and large impacted proximal ureteral stones. After positioning in either the supine or prone position, a cystoscopy is performed to place an open-ended catheter, occlusion balloon, or Accordian device into the collecting system. A foley catheter is placed in the bladder. An ultrasound with a curvilinear probe is used to survey the kidney and guide access into the collecting system with an 18 g percutaneous needle. Once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin incision is made and the percutaneous tract is dilated over a wire. A 16.5F metallic or self-dilating suctioning access sheath is positioned with fluoroscopic guidance. A 12F rigid mini-PCNL nephroscope is used to evaluate the collecting system. Once a calculus is observed, options for stone fragmentation include a lithotripter with ultrasonic and ballistic energy, or laser lithotripsy using holmium or thulium laser fibers. Flexible ureteroscopy can be considered to ensure clearance of the collecting system. A 6F ureteral stent can be placed in either a retrograde or antegrade approach for drainage. The tract is sealed using Surgiflo hemostatic matrix with thrombin. Guidelines for postoperative care and troubleshooting techniques for mini-PCNL are reviewed along with the surgical steps in the accompanying video (Supplementary Video S1). There are few randomized trials comparing mini-PCNL with standard PCNL and ureteroscopy.

"Background: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) versus standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with renal and upper ureteric stones. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The eligible RCTs were selected from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The reference lists of retrieved studies were also investigated. Results: Our analysis included 10 RCTs with 1612 patients. Pooled data from 10 RCTs revealed the following: stone-free rate (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.12,1.88], P = .004), operative time (mean difference [MD] = 4.10, 95% CI [-1.37,9.56], P = .14), length of hospital stay (MD = -15.31, 95% CI [-29.43,-1.19], P = .03), hemoglobin decrease (MD = -0.86, 95% CI [-1.19,-0.53], P < .00001), postoperative fever (MD = 0.83, 95% CI [0.49,1.40], P = .49), and urine leakage (MD = 0.59, 95% CI [0.25,1.37], P = .22). Besides, we performed sub-group analysis based on vacuum suction effect and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it revealed the following: stone-free rate in vacuum suction group (P = .007) and in non-vacuum suction group (P = .19). Operative time in vacuum suction group (P = .89), non-vacuum suction group (P = .16). Postoperative fever in vacuum suction group (P = .49), non-vacuum suction group (P = .85). Conclusion: This pooled analysis indicated that MPCNL was a safe and effective method for treating renal stones compared with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Besides, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn stones, the longer operative time in MPCNL could not be ignored.","Rickettsial infections are a common cause of hospitalization in tropical settings , although early , definitive diagnosis is challenging in the rural and remote locations where they are usually seen .

"Mini-Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (M-PCNL) and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS) are commonly used methods in treatment of kidney stones. The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of M-PCNL and RIRS in kidney stone treatment over 50 years old patients. A total of 125 patients, 65 of whom had RIRS, and 60 of whom had M-PCNL, were included in the study. Age, gender, BMI (Body-Mass Index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, ESWL history, HU (Hounsfield Unit) values, hospital stay durations, SFR, complication rates according to Clavien modification system, postoperative hemoglobin loss, postoperative transfusion rates, and patients who needed a secondary operation were recorded. SFR values were calculated in the postoperative third and sixth months. The data between the two groups had similar characteristics in terms of age, gender, BMI, HU, stone size, operation side, stone location, ESWL history, operation time, postoperative transfusion rate, postoperative Clavien complications (p > 0.05). When the ASA categories were evaluated, the mean ASA scores, ASA I, and ASA II data had similar characteristics in both groups (p > 0.05). When the ASA 3 scores were evaluated, the number of ASA III patients in the RIRS group was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05). When hospital stay duration and postoperative hemoglobin loss were examined, RIRS group was found to be advantageous (p < 0.05). Postoperative third month SFR and Postoperative sixth month values were statistically significantly higher in M-PCNL group (p < 0.05). M-PCNL and RIRS are methods that can be used safely and effectively over 50 years old patients in kidney stone surgery. M-PCNL has been found to be more advantageous in terms of SFR rates and as it requires less secondary intervention. RIRS is advantageous in terms of short hospital stay, postoperative hemoglobin loss, and applicability to patients who are not suitable for the prone position.","Cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) is characterized by skin ulcerations and occurs in rural poor areas of developing countries .

"Renal stones pose a significant burden on the health care system. The prevalence of renal stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, with annual healthcare costs of USD 3.8 billion. It is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. The most common presenting symptoms include hematuria, pain in the flank, groin, or abdomen. There are many treatment modalities available for managing renal stones. They range from completely non-invasive outpatient procedures to invasive procedures requiring hospital admission and increased risks of complications. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The efficacy of ESWL lies in its ability to pulverize calculi in vivo into smaller segments, which are them expelled spontaneously by the boy. Shockwaves are generated and are then focused on a point within the body. The shockwaves propagate through the body with minimal dissipation of energy (and therefore damage) due to minimal difference in density of the soft tissues. At the stone fluid interface, a relatively significant difference in density, combined with a large concentration of multiple shockwaves in a small area, produces a significant dissipation of energy. Through the different mechanisms, this energy can overcome the tensile strength of the stone resulting in fragmentation. Repetition of this process leads to the pulverization of the stone into small fragments that the body then can pass painlessly and spontaneously.","This paper presents a unique dissipation mode of converting biochemical free energy in ATP to regulatory function through the MinCDE bio-oscillator that marks the mid-cell position for symmetric bacterial cell division .

"Background Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the first choice treatment of renal stones larger than 2 cm. We aimed to evaluate if lasers perform as equal as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones candidate to PCNL. Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to assess the differences in the perioperative course, incidence of postoperative complications, and stone free-rate (SFR) in patients with kidney stones undergoing laser versus non-laser PCNL in randomized studies. The incidences of complications were pooled using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Method with the random effect model and expressed as Risk Ratios (RR), 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), and p-values. Surgical time and length of stay were pooled using the inverse variance of the mean difference (MD) with a random effect, 95% CI, and p-values. Analyses were two-tailed, with a significance set at p ≤0.05. Results Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients undergoing holmium laser and 421 non-laser PCNL) were included in meta-analysis. Surgical time and postoperative stay were shorter in the non-laser group (MD:11.14, 95% CI:2.32-19.96, p=0.002; MD:-0.81, 95%CI:-2.18-0.57 p=0.25, respectively). SFR was significantly higher in the non-laser group (RR:1.08, 95% CI:1.01-1.15, p=0.03). Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a non-significant higher risk of postoperative fever >38°C (RR:0.64, 95%CI: .31-1.30, p=0.22). Transfusion rate did not differ between the two groups (RR:1.02, 95% CI:0.50-2.11 p=0.95). The need for stent positioning due to urine extravasation was higher risk in the laser group but the difference did not reach significance (RR:0.49, 95% CI:0.17-1.41 p=0.19). Conclusions Non-laser PCNL showed better perioperative outcomes and SFR as compared to holmium laser PCNL.","Rickettsial infections are a common cause of hospitalization in tropical settings , although early , definitive diagnosis is challenging in the rural and remote locations where they are usually seen .

"The primary goals of medical expulsive therapy are to increase the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter to avoid ureteral obstruction and reduce ureteral colic and thus avoid the need for surgical and more invasive interventions. This review focussed on the findings from in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies that have investigated the pharmacological mechanisms controlling ureteral motility and their translation to current and potentially new clinically used drugs for increasing the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter. The complicated contractility profile of the ureter, which alters with age, tissue segment region, orientation and species contributes to the difficulty of interpreting studies on ureteral pharmacology, which translates to the complexity of discovering ideal drug targets for medical expulsive therapy. Nevertheless, the current drug classes clinically used for patients with stone lodgement include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers and NSAIDS, whilst there are promising targets for drug development that require further clinical investigations including the phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme, β-adrenoceptors and 5-HT receptors.",The plaintiff wanted to cancel the contract because both parties were fundamentally wrong about a critical aspect of the deal when they made it.

"Eight types of short-chain Lys acylations have recently been identified on histones: propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation and β-hydroxybutyrylation. Emerging evidence suggests that these histone modifications affect gene expression and are structurally and functionally different from the widely studied histone Lys acetylation. In this Review, we discuss the regulation of non-acetyl histone acylation by enzymatic and metabolic mechanisms, the acylation 'reader' proteins that mediate the effects of different acylations and their physiological functions, which include signal-dependent gene activation, spermatogenesis, tissue injury and metabolic stress. We propose a model to explain our present understanding of how differential histone acylation is regulated by the metabolism of the different acyl-CoA forms, which in turn modulates the regulation of gene expression.","An evolutionary conserved orchestra of transcription factors controls cardiac development and function .

Here , we show the impact of the interdependencies of four key transcription factors ( Gata4 , Mef2a , Nkx2 . 5 , and Srf ) and the contribution of activating histone modifications and microRNAs on the cardiac transcriptome . We found that even these non-paralogous transcription factors can partially compensate each other's function . Our data show that histone 3 acetylation correlates with Srf- and Gata4- dependent gene activation . Moreover , we predict a large proportion of indirect Srf targets to be regulated by Srf-dependent microRNAs , which thus might represent an important intermediate layer of regulation . Taken together , we suggest that the different levels regulating cardiac mRNA profiles have a high degree of interdependency and the potential to buffer each other , which presents a starting point to understand the phenotypic variability typically seen in complex cardiovascular disorders ."
"Over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. Initially, histones were only known as DNA packaging proteins but later, it was discovered that they act extracellularly as powerful antimicrobial agents and also as potentially self-detrimental agents. Indeed, histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps what ultimately highlighted their microbicidal function. In addition, extracellular histones proved to be involved in triggering exacerbated inflammatory and coagulation responses, depending on the cell type affected. Consequently, several investigations were conducted towards studying the potential of histones and their derivatives as either biomarkers or therapeutic target candidates in different diseases in which inflammation and thrombosis have a key pathophysiological role, such as sepsis, thrombosis and different types of cancer. The main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the current state of the art with regard to both beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","This paper provides an overview of recent advancements in computational methods for modeling macromolecular structure and dynamics .

"Histones are known for their ability to bind to and regulate expression of DNA. However, histones are also present in cytoplasm and extracellular fluids where they serve host defense functions and promote inflammatory responses.

"Background: The oncogenic role of histone mutations is one of the most relevant discovery in cancer epigenetics. Recurrent mutations targeting histone genes have been described in pediatric brain tumors, chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor of bone and other tumor types. The demonstration that mutant histones can be oncogenic and drive the tumorigenesis in pediatric tumors, led to the coining of the term ""oncohistones."" The first identified histone mutations were localized at or near residues normally targeted by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the histone N-terminal tails and suggested a possible interference with histone PTMs regulation and reading. Main body: In this review, we describe the peculiar organization of the multiple genes that encode histone proteins, and the latter advances in both the identification and the biological role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurrent somatic mutations target both N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domain in diverse tumor types. Oncohistones are often dominant-negative and occur at higher frequencies in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases the mutations target selectively only some of the genes coding the same histone protein and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or, as documented for histone variant H3.3 in pediatric glioma, with peculiar tumors arising from specific anatomic locations. Conclusion: The overview of the most recent advances suggests that the oncogenic potential of histone mutations can be exerted, together with the alteration of histone PTMs, through the destabilization of nucleosome and DNA-nucleosome interactions, as well as through the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure. However, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of oncohistones, as well as to evaluate their possible application to cancer classification, prognosis and to the identification of new therapies.","Packaging of eukaryotic genomes by the histone proteins influences many processes that use the DNA , such as transcription , repair , and replication . One well-known mechanism of regulation of histone function is the covalent modification of histone proteins . Replacement of modified histones by new histones has recently emerged as an additional layer of regulation ( hereafter referred to as histone turnover ) . Although histone replacement can affect substantial parts of eukaryotic genomes , the mechanisms that control histone exchange are largely unknown . Here , we report a screening method for epigenetic regulators that we applied to search for histone exchange factors . The screening method is based on our finding that global chromatin changes in mutant cells can be inferred from chromatin states on short DNA barcodes . By analyzing the chromatin status of DNA barcodes of many yeast mutants in parallel , we identified positive and negative regulators of histone exchange . In particular , we find that the HAT-B complex promotes histone turnover . HAT-B is known to acetylate the tails of newly synthesized histones , but its role in chromatin assembly has been unclear . Hif1 , the nuclear binding partner of HAT-B in the NuB4 complex , also promotes histone exchange but by non-overlapping mechanisms . These results provide a new perspective on pathways of histone exchange ."
"Extracellular histones released from injured or dying cells following trauma and other severe insults can act as potent damage-associated molecular patterns. In fact, elevated levels of histones are present in human circulation in hyperinflammatory states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. The molecular mechanisms owing to histone-induced pathologies are at the very beginning of elucidating. However, neutralization of histones with antibodies, histone-binding or histone-degrading proteins, and heparan sulfates have shown promising therapeutic effects in pre-clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis models. Various cell types undergoing necrosis and apoptosis or activated neutrophils forming neutrophil extracellular traps have been implicated in excessive release of histones which further augments tissue injury and may culminate in multiple organ failure. At the molecular level, an uncontrolled inflammatory cascade has been considered as the major event; however, histone-activated coagulation and thrombosis represent additional pathologic events reflecting coagulopathy. Furthermore, epigenetic regulation and chemical modifications of circulating histones appear to be critically important in their biological functions as evidenced by increased cytotoxicity associated with citrullinated histone. Herein, we will briefly review the current knowledge on the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss the future potential of anti-histone therapy for treatment of these life-threatening disorders.","In Iran , cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) is a widespread and highly endemic disease in young individuals . To date , treatment strategy is based on chemotherapy accompanied with high incidence of toxicity and drug resistance . Distinctive mode of action of defensins ( members of antimicrobial peptides ) with low susceptibility to resistance and low toxicity to mammalian cells makes them suitable candidates for anti-leishmanial agents . The most active human defensin is human neutrophil peptide-1 ( HNP-1 ) produced by neutrophils; the first effector cells during Leishmania infection . In this work , we used recombinant HNP-1 ( rHNP-1 ) against both the promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania ( L . ) major . Furthermore , immunomodulatory effect of rHNP-1 on Leishmania-infected neutrophils was investigated . Our result showed that rHNP-1 has anti-parasitic effect against L . major promastigotes and amastigotes and also reduces infectivity rate of Leishmania-infected neutrophils . Moreover , assessment of cytokine production from Leishmania-infected neutrophils reveals an increase in TNF-α and a decrease in TGF-β production after rHNP-1 treatment; a cytokine pattern anticipated to facilitate control of parasites . The immunomodulatory effect of rHNP-1 on cytokine production from parasite-infected neutrophils besides its direct effect on free parasites is considered as promising step towards developing new anti-leishmanial agents ."
"Linker histones are major players in chromatin organization and per se are essential players in genome homeostasis. As the fifth class of histone proteins the linker histones not only interact with DNA and core histones but also with other chromatin proteins. These interactions prove to be essential for the higher levels of chromatin organization like chromatin loops, transcription factories and chromosome territories. Our recent results have proved that Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone - Hho1p, physically interacts with the actin-related protein 4 (Arp4) and that the abrogation of this interaction through the deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global changes in chromatin compaction. Here, we show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is critical for maintaining genome stability and for controlling cellular sensitivity to different types of stress. The abolished interaction between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature ageing phenotypes. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress.

"The linker histones (H1, H1 zero, H5, etc.) and a group of abundant non-histone chromosomal proteins (HMG1/2) bind to linker DNA in chromatin and exhibit both generalized and specific effects on gene transcription. The two classes of proteins share many features of DNA binding behaviour, although they are structurally unrelated. While the linker histones and HMG1/2 exhibit direct competition in binding to such structures as four-way junction DNA, whether they compete for binding to the nucleosome has not been investigated. The possibility for either opposite or synergistic effects on gene regulation must be considered at this point.","The DNA of all eukaryotic organisms is packaged into nucleosomes , which cover roughly of the genome . As nucleosome positioning profoundly affects DNA accessibility to other DNA binding proteins such as transcription factors ( TFs ) , it plays an important role in transcription regulation . However , to what extent nucleosome positioning is guided by intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes , and to what extent other DNA binding factors play a role , is currently highly debated . Here we use a rigorous biophysical model to systematically study the relative contributions of intrinsic sequence preferences and competitive binding of TFs to nucleosome positioning in yeast . We find that , on the one hand , the phasing of the many small spacers within dense nucleosome arrays that cover gene bodies are mainly determined by intrinsic sequence preferences . On the other hand , larger nucleosome free regions ( NFRs ) in promoters are explained predominantly by TF binding . Strikingly , we find that only 10–20 TFs make a significant contribution to explaining NFRs , and these TFs are highly enriched for directly interacting with chromatin modifiers . Thus , the picture that emerges is that binding by a specific class of TFs recruits chromatin modifiers which mediate local nucleosome expulsion ."
"Histones constitute the chief protein component of DNA. They help to maintain chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around histone octamers to form nucleosomes which serve the purpose of compacting DNA within the confines of the nuclear membrane. There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4. H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently. Amino acids such as lysine and arginine found in the histone tails are sites of post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as methylation and acetylation. These PTMs in histones are involved in the regulation of gene expression by chromatin remodelling and by controlling DNA methylation patterns. Mutations in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs causing changes in local and global DNA methylation status. These effects are directly linked to neoplastic transformation by altered gene expression. Recurrent H3.3 histone mutations are increasingly identified in several malignancies and developmental disorders. The following review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with H3.3 histone mutations.","Eukaryotes package their DNA to fit within the nucleus using well-conserved proteins , called histones , that form the building blocks of nucleosomes , the fundamental units of chromatin .

"cHistone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are essential for regulating chromatin and maintaining gene expression throughout cell differentiation. Despite the deep level of understanding of immunophenotypic differentiation pathways in hematopoietic cells, few studies have investigated global levels of histone PTMs required for differentiation and maintenance of these distinct cell types. Here, we describe an approach to couple fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with targeted mass spectrometry to define global ""epi-proteomic"" signatures for primary leukocytes. FACS was used to sort closely and distantly related leukocytes from normal human peripheral blood for quantitation of histone PTMs with a multiple reaction monitoring LC-MS/MS method measuring histone PTMs on histones H3 and H4. We validate cell sorting directly into H2SO4 for immediate histone extraction to decrease time and number of steps after FACS to analyze histone PTMs. Relative histone PTM levels vary in T cells across healthy donors, and the majority of PTMs remain stable up to 2 days following initial blood draw. Large differences in the levels of histone PTMs are observed across the mature lymphoid and myeloid lineages, as well as between different types within the same lineage, though no differences are observed in closely related T cell subtypes. The results show a streamlined approach for quantifying global changes in histone PTMs in cell types separated by FACS that is poised for clinical deployment.","The quest of modern developmental biology is a detailed molecular description of the process that leads from the fertilized egg to the complex and highly differentiated adult organism . This process is controlled largely on the level of gene expression . While early embryonic cells are pluripotent and capable of transcribing most of their genome , older cells have become committed to the germ layer and differentiation programs during gastrulation . They express then a subset of genes compatible with their future physiological function . Young , pluripotent cells and post-gastrula , committed cells express different networks of transcription factors and contain chromatin of different structure and composition . How these two regulatory layers are interconnected during development is incompletely understood . We describe a novel and unexpected link between the pluripotency-associated POU-V gene Oct-25 and xSuv4-20h histone methyltransferases . XSuv4-20h enzymes are required to repress the Oct-25 gene , a homolog of mammalian Oct4 , in the neuroectoderm of frog embryos as a prerequisite for neural differentiation . Consistently , murine Suv4-20h double-null ES cells show increased Oct4 protein levels before and during in vitro differentiation and display compromised differentiation in comparison to wild-type ES cells . Thus , Suv4-20h enzymes control specific POU-V genes and are involved in germ-layer specific differentiation ."
"Background: While the genomes of eukaryotes and Archaea both encode the histone-fold domain, only eukaryotes encode the core histone paralogs H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. With DNA, these core histones assemble into the nucleosomal octamer underlying eukaryotic chromatin. Importantly, core histones for H2A and H3 are maintained as neofunctionalized paralogs adapted for general bulk chromatin (canonical H2 and H3) or specialized chromatin (H2A. Z enriched at gene promoters and cenH3s enriched at centromeres). In this context, the identification of core histone-like ""doublets"" in the cytoplasmic replication factories of the Marseilleviridae (MV) is a novel finding with possible relevance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. Here, we analyze and compare the core histone doublet genes from all known MV genomes as well as other MV genes relevant to the origin of the eukaryotic replisome. Results: Using different phylogenetic approaches, we show that MV histone domains encode obligate H2B-H2A and H4-H3 dimers of possible proto-eukaryotic origin. MV core histone moieties form sister clades to each of the four eukaryotic clades of canonical and variant core histones. This suggests that MV core histone moieties diverged prior to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations associated with paired linear chromosomes and variant histone octamer assembly. We also show that MV genomes encode a proto-eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II enzyme that forms a sister clade to eukaryotes. This is a relevant finding given that DNA topo II influences histone deposition and chromatin compaction and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. Conclusions: The combined domain architecture and phylogenomic analyses presented here suggest that a primitive origin for MV histone genes is a more parsimonious explanation than horizontal gene transfers + gene fusions + sufficient divergence to eliminate relatedness to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within the H2A and H3 clades without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone clades. We thus suggest MV histone doublet genes and their DNA topo II gene possibly were acquired from an organism with a chromatinized replisome that diverged prior to the origin of eukaryotic core histone variants for H2/H2A.Z and H3/cen H3. These results also imply that core histones were utilized ancestrally in viral DNA compaction and/or protection from host endonucleases.","Eukaryotes package their DNA to fit within the nucleus using well-conserved proteins , called histones , that form the building blocks of nucleosomes , the fundamental units of chromatin .

"Therapeutic success in treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is limited by the multivariate disease etiology, multi-organ presentation, systemic involvement, and complex immunopathogenesis.

"As treatment options in advanced systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are limited, there is an urgent need for new and effective therapeutic alternatives for selected cases with severe disease. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a specific, reversible, inhibitor of the 20S subunit of the proteasome. Herein, we report clinical experience regarding efficacy and safety from all patients receiving BTZ as therapy for SLE in Sweden during the years 2014-2020. 8 females and 4 males were included with a mean disease duration at BTZ initiation of 8.8 years (range 0.7-20 years). Renal involvement was the main target for BTZ. Reduction of global disease activity was recorded by decreasing SLEDAI-2K scores over time and remained significantly reduced at the 6-month (p=0.007) and the 12-month (p=0.008) follow-up visits. From BTZ initiation, complement protein 3 (C3) levels increased significantly after the 2nd treatment cycle (p=0.05), the 6-month (p=0.03) and the 12-month (p=0.04) follow-up visits. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio declined over time and reached significance at the 6-month (p=0.008) and the 12-month follow-up visits (p=0.004). Seroconversion of anti-dsDNA (27%), anti-C1q (50%) and anti-Sm (67%) was observed. 6 of 12 patients experienced at least one side-effect during follow-up, whereof the most common adverse events were infections. Safety parameters (C-reactive protein, blood cell counts) mainly remained stable over time. To conclude, we report favorable therapeutic effects of BTZ used in combination with corticosteroids in a majority of patients with severe SLE manifestations irresponsive to conventional immunosuppressive agents. Reduction of proteinuria was observed over time as well as seroconversion of some autoantibody specificities. In most patients, tolerance was acceptable but mild adverse events was not uncommon. Special attention should be paid to infections and hypogammaglobinemia.","Cutaneous and muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL/MCL ) are disfiguring diseases caused by a worldwide distributed parasite called Leishmania and its 20 species . Clinical manifestations span a wide continuum from single nodular lesion to disseminated form with mucosal involvement . Though local treatment with cryotherapy and intralesionnal antimony or topical formulations of paromomycin is generally adequate in most of situations , some patients with complex CL/MCL require systemic therapy . No convenient regimen has been proved to be safe and effective for all infecting species , all clinical forms and all patients ( e . g . children , pregnant women , adults with comorbidities or immunosuppression ) . In this study , the authors examined in returning travelers with CL/MCL the effectiveness of an antifungal agent “liposomal amphotericin B” ( L-AmB ) , which is highly effective in visceral leishmaniasis . Surprisingly , rates of healing were lower than in previous reports in this unselected population that reflects clinical practice in non-endemic countries . The observations also suggest that some Leishmania species ( namely , L . infantum ) may be more susceptible to L-AmB than others . Occurrence of adverse events should raises the question of the benefit-risk balance of L-AmB in CL/MCL . Careful attention to comorbidities and adoption of strict protocols for administration are pre-requisites for the use of L-AmB in patients with CL/MCL ."
"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Although previous studies have demonstrated that SLE is related to the imbalance of cells in the immune system, including B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells, etc., the mechanisms underlying SLE pathogenesis remain unclear. Therefore, effective and low side-effect therapies for SLE are lacking. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy for autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE, has gained increasing attention. This therapy can improve the signs and symptoms of refractory SLE by promoting the proliferation of Th2 and Treg cells and inhibiting the activity of Th1, Th17, and B cells, etc. However, MSC therapy is also reported ineffective in some patients with SLE, which may be related to MSC- or patient-derived factors. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs should be further confirmed. This review summarizes the status of MSC therapy in refractory SLE treatment and potential reasons for the ineffectiveness of MSC therapy from three perspectives. We propose various MSC modification methods that may be beneficial in enhancing the immunosuppression of MSCs in SLE. However, their safety and protective effects in patients with SLE still need to be confirmed by further experimental and clinical evidence.","Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , a debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies , has a strong genetic basis .

"Significance: Metformin has been proposed as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The primary target of metformin, the electron transport chain complex I in the mitochondria, is associated with redox homeostasis in immune cells, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

"Introduction: Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) selectively restores disturbances of regulatory T cells (Treg) and conventional T cells, resulting in the induction of remission in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, to date no research has been carried out on the efficacy of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the renal response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with refractory LN. Methods: The study population comprised ten patients with refractory LN who failed to achieve complete response or who had relapsed while being treated with at least two conventional immunosuppressive agents. One treatment cycle consisted of IL-2 at a dose of 1 million IU administered subcutaneously every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients received three cycles of IL-2 and were then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of previous immunosuppressive agents and steroids. Results: Of the ten patients enrolled in the study, seven (70%) achieved ≥ 50% improvement in proteinuria at 12 weeks after initiating treatment with IL-2. Median proteinuria was significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12, from 1.83 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.23-3.21) g/24 h at baseline to 0.91 (IQR 0.52-1.60) g/24 h at 12 weeks (P = 0.005). This was accompanied by a 71% reduction in urine erythrocytes, from 64/µl (IQR 24-102/µl) at baseline to 18/µl (IQR 2-20/µl) at 12 weeks (P = 0.018). Anti-ds DNA was decreased from 27.9 (IQR 7.6-40.28) IU/ml at baseline to 14.1 (IQR 7.3-20.12) IU/ml (P = 0.021) at week 12, while complements C3 and C4 were slightly increased (P = 0.445, P = 0.241, respectively). A significant expansion of Treg cells, from 9.3% at baseline to 16.6% at 12 weeks, was also found (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events occurred during the treatment period. Conclusions: Low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory LN as an alternative and safe therapeutic approach. It may be used as multi-target combination therapy in clinical practice.","In sub-Saharan Africa countries , vaccines are administered to people who may suffer from existing infections , especially helminth infections .

"Objective: Randomised trials of type I anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab and ocrelizumab failed to show benefit in proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). We compared obinutuzumab, a humanised type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that induces potent B-cell depletion, with placebo for the treatment of LN in combination with standard therapies. Methods: Patients with LN receiving mycophenolate and corticosteroids were randomised to obinutuzumab 1000 mg or placebo on day 1 and weeks 2, 24 and 26, and followed through week 104. The primary endpoint was complete renal response (CRR) at week 52. Exploratory analyses through week 104 were conducted. The prespecified alpha level was 0.2. Results: A total of 125 patients were randomised and received blinded infusions. Achievement of CRR was greater with obinutuzumab at week 52 (primary endpoint, 22 (35%) vs 14 (23%) with placebo; percentage difference, 12% (95% CI -3.4% to 28%), p=0.115) and at week 104 (26 (41%) vs 14 (23%); percentage difference, 19% (95% CI 2.7% to 35%), p=0.026). Improvements in other renal response measures, serologies, estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria were greater with obinutuzumab. Obinutuzumab was not associated with increases in serious adverse events, serious infections or deaths. Non-serious infusion-related reactions occurred more frequently with obinutuzumab. Conclusions: Improved renal responses through week 104 were observed in patients with LN who received obinutuzumab plus standard therapies compared with standard therapies alone. Obinutuzumab was well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified.","Visceral leishmaniasis , or kala-azar , is a parasitic disease which is fatal without treatment .

"Objective: To determine the relative effectiveness and safety of belimumab and anifrolumab in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Materials and methods: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness and safety of belimumab 10 mg, anifrolumab 300 mg, and a placebo in patients with active SLE. Results: Six RCTs (2,757 patients) were included in this study. The response rate based on the SLE 4 Responder Index (SRI4) at 52 weeks was substantially higher in the belimumab 10-mg and anifrolumab 300-mg groups than that in the placebo group (OR 2.90, % credible intervals (CrIs) 2.37 - 3.56; OR 1.60, % CrI 1.22 - 2.08).

"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune connective tissue disease with unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and MSC derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in regulating innate and adaptive immunity, which are involved in many physiological and pathological processes and contribute to the immune homeostasis in SLE. The effects of MSCs and EVs on SLE have been drawing more and more attention during the past few years. This article reviews the immunomodulatory effects and underlying mechanisms of MSC/MSC-EVs in SLE, which provides novel insight into understanding SLE pathogenesis and guiding the biological therapy.","We have analyzed DNA methylation , an epigenetic modification that influences gene expression , in lupus patients and control subjects .

"Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most frequent severe organ manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). About 30% of patients are refractory to treatment. The authors report a case of treatment of LN with interleukin-17-targeted therapy, demonstrating its possible benefit, after reports of T helper 17 cell involvement in SLE pathogenesis. We present the case of a childbearing age woman with SLE, who developed refractory LN despite all the indicated therapeutic options. During follow up, infection with human papillomavirus was detected, a possible trigger, and the following management was based on this discovery. We currently know that cytokines play a major role in tissue damage and interleukin-17 (IL-17) seems to be a fundamental key in SLE and LN, having shown its expression in renal glomeruli and urinary sediment. Thus, it was decided to start treatment with an anti-IL-17A antibody, secukinumab.

"Objectives: To characterize the relationship of anifrolumab pharmacokinetics with efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe SLE despite standard therapy, using pooled data from 2 phase 3 trials. Methods: TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 were randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trials of intravenous anifrolumab (every 4 weeks for 48 weeks). For the exposure-response analysis, BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) or SLE Responder Index (SRI[4]) response rates at week 52 in each quartile/tertile of average anifrolumab serum concentration (Cave) were compared for anifrolumab and placebo in all-comers, patients who completed treatment, and interferon gene signature (IFNGS)-high patients who completed treatment, using average marginal effect logistic regression. Relationships between exposure and key safety events were assessed graphically. Results: Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who received anifrolumab (150 mg [n = 91], 300 mg [n = 356]) or placebo (n = 366), 574 completed treatment, of whom 470 were IFNGS high.

"Objectives: Level of βhCG and the presence of any uterine mass of hydatidiform mole need a careful review or monitoring in order to prevent metastasis, provide an early treatment and avoid unnecessary chemotherapy. Case presentation: A 36-year old fifth gravida patient who had a missed abortion was diagnosed as having a molar pregnancy with beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG) level of 509,921 IU/L. Her lung field was clear and she underwent suction and curettage (S & C) procedure. However, after six weeks, AA presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding, although her βhCG level had decreased to 65,770 IU/L. A trans-abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass (3.0 × 4.4 cm). Nevertheless, her βhCG continued to show a declining trend (8,426 IU/L). AA was advised to undergo a chemotherapy but she refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead. She opted for an ""at own risk"" (AOR) discharge with scheduled follow up. Subsequently, her condition improved with her βhCG showing a downward trend. Surprisingly, at six months post S & C, her βhCG ameliorated to 0 IU/L with no mass detected by ultrasound. Conclusions: Brucea javanica fruits, Pereskia bleo and Annona muricata leaves can potentially be useful alternatives to chemotherapy and need further studies.","Her family is present , and I have discussed her case with her mother and sister ."
"Objective: To examine patients after embryo transfer for predictive influence of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery. Methods: 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET treatment placed in the study. The influence of other factors: age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss and the possibility to predict multiple pregnancy was also related to the known hCG value. The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs). The answer here, therefore, is a multinomial variable with four levels. For that reason the data was analysed through a multinomial logistic model vs. multinomial distribution of a mistake and generalised logistic link function. Results: The hCG level grows exponentially in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET). The probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation (96 or 120 hrs) grows with the average and above-average hCG values on the day of the draw. The hCG value was 678 (564-815) IU/l1 on the 14th day after ET in pregnancy ended in delivery, 321 (216-477) IU/l on average in abortion, 82 (51-132) IU/l in biochemical pregnancy and 1070 (737-1554) IU/l in multiple pregnancy. The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values greatly above the average and on the other hand, below-average values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. The patients age was not proven to be of significant influence, the hCG level slightly decreased with higher age. On the contrary, an increasing frequency of abortions depending on the increasing age of the mother was once again confirmed. Conclusion: The measured hCG values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result, which is why this value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result.","This mother-baby cohort study continued our investigations into the potential impact of a mother’s parasitic infection ( s ) during pregnancy on a baby’s ability to respond to early life vaccinations . In a rural Kenyan setting where malaria and helminth infections are common , we tested infants’ anti-vaccine antibody responses over time for up to three years of age after early vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae ( the pneumococcus ) , diphtheria , and Haemophilus influenzae B ( Hib ) . In contrast to the results for our previous 2006–2009 cohort , for whom antenatal parasite exposure reduced responses to diphtheria and Hib , our more recent 2013–2015 cohort did not show consistent evidence of an effect of antenatal maternal infection on subsequent infant vaccine responses . We conclude that the impact of antenatal infections on infant immune response can be mitigated , and that present-day screening and preventive therapies during pregnancy may have achieved this effect ."
"Introduction: The presentation of Ectopic Pregnancy (EP) can be highly variable and serum Beta hCG estimation plays an important role in early diagnosis. Aim: Aim of the study was to determine the trends of hCG levels in EP and to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care centre in southern India was carried out. These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol. Results: The study identified 337 women with EP. Thirty one surgically confirmed cases were diagnosed below the discriminatory zone of 1500 mIU/ml. Among women who had Beta hCG estimations 48 hours apart, plateauing was observed in 22.5% while decrease >15% was noted in 26.8%. Almost half (47.9%) of the cases had an increase >15% and a few (2.8%) demonstrated an initial fall followed by a rise in titres. In 23.9% of these women, there was a rise >53% similar to intrauterine pregnancy. The average pre-treatment Beta hCG was 429.8, 3866.2 and 12961.5 mIU/ml for those who received expectant, medical and direct surgical treatment respectively. 43 women with relative contraindications received medical management and 39 were lost to follow-up after medical and expectant management. Excluding them, the success rate of these two modalities was 76.6% and 85.0% respectively. Conclusion: No single level of Beta hCG is diagnostic of EP and serial levels can demonstrate atypical trends in some cases. Hence, interpretation of these results should be done in conjunction with clinical and sonographic findings to arrive at a correct diagnosis.","International guidelines recommend routine prevention and treatments which are safe and effective during pregnancy to reduce hookworm , malaria and other infections among pregnant women living in geographic areas where these infections are prevalent .

"The objective was to determine the strength of relationship between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Consecutive records of the database of our Down screening project were assessed for free β-hCG levels and pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancies with foetal chromosomal or structural anomalies and those with underlying disease were excluded. Free β-hCG levels of < 0.5, > 0.5 and < 2.0, and ≥ 2.0 MoM were categorised as low, normal and high, respectively. Of 17,082 screened women, 13,620 were available for analysis. In the first trimester (n = 8150), low β-hCG levels significantly increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW) and low Apgar score with relative risk of 1.66, 1.43, 1.83 and 2.89; whereas high β-hCG group had a significant decreased risk of preterm birth and GDM with relative risk of 0.73 and 0.62. In the second trimester (n = 5470), both low and high β-hCG groups had significant increased risks of the most common adverse outcomes, i.e. spontaneous abortion, IUGR and preterm birth. In conclusion, abnormally low (< 0.5MoM) or high (> 2.0 MoM) free β-hCG levels are generally associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Nevertheless, high free β-hCG levels in the first trimester may possibly decrease risk of preterm delivery and GDM.","Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality , and prematurity is further associated with serious morbidities in later life . Genetic and environmental risk factors play a role in the susceptibility to preterm birth . Despite numerous studies , the genetic basis for preterm birth remains poorly defined . We investigated the presence of rare , possibly risk associated nucleotide variants in mothers with spontaneous preterm births ( SPTB ) . The first set of mothers with family history of recurrent preterm births was of northern Finnish origin . An additional set of mothers ( sister pairs , both giving birth preterm ) of European origin was also studied . Whole exome sequencing identified multiple rare , likely damaging HSPA1L variants in several families affected by SPTB , and this gene was associated with the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway . Potential involvement of one of the HSPA1L variants in SPTB was further supported by large GWAS dataset . In addition , this variant alters protein post-translational modification potential , and thus may affect protein stability and its function as a chaperone ."
"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is generally quantified in serum, but spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG. A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients, including cases of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7, during medical treatment and comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. The histogram of relative urinary/serum hCG(U-hCG.act/S-hCG) of the samples showed a wide distribution of values, but tended to converge to a narrow distribution by creatinine correction (U-hCG.cor/S-hCG). U-hCG.cor/S-hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups decreased 1 day to 14 days or was no earlier than 15 days postoperatively compared to preoperatively. The alteration of serum Intact/Total tended to be similar to that of U-hCG.cor/S-hCG in clinical course. The presented case indicated that U-hCG.act/S-hCG did not correspond to serum hCG levels. Because urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted, the levels of hCG in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG. Therefore, the data of urinary hCG should be interpreted after creatinine correction. Overall, it is recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than creatinine corrected urinary hCG levels, considering that the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant postoperatively.","Recent momentum for the control of neglected tropical diseases has generated a renewed interest in the control of schistosomiasis , resulting in the increase of large scale mass drug administration of praziquantel in several countries . As a consequence , there is a need to develop more sensitive diagnostic tools , especially for Schistosoma mansoni , in order to help targeting control or develop better screening strategies for elimination . We evaluated the commercially available point-of-contact circulating cathodic antigen ( CCA ) as a potential tool for the screening of S . mansoni infections . Our results showed that urine CCA assay had a better sensitivity for detecting S . mansoni infections than single and triplicate Kato-Katz thick smears . The prevalence obtained with CCA was similar or higher than that obtained with nine Kato-Katz . Neither STH nor S . haematobium infections had any impact on the CCA test results . Although further studies are required for its refinement and validation , the overall results revealed CCA as a promising and easy to use tool for the diagnosis of S . mansoni ."
"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether subfertility, measured as longer time-to-pregnancy (TTP) in spontaneously conceived pregnancies, affects the first trimester levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) and hence the risk estimates in Down syndrome screening. Methods: The study included a cohort of 10 469 singleton pregnant women who underwent first trimester combined screening and responded to a questionnaire regarding TTP. PAPP-A and free β-hCG levels were measured between gestational week 8 + 0 and 13 + 6 and were related to TTP. Results: The median PAPP-A and free β-hCG MoMs were significantly lower in women with a TTP ≥24 months compared with the reference group with a TTP <6 months (PAPP-A: 0.96 vs 1.06 MoM, p = 0.003; free β-hCG: 1.04 vs 1.12 MoM, p = 0.03). This led to an increased odds for trisomy 21 risk ≥1 : 300 for TTP ≥24 months compared with TTP <6 months, but when adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio (OR) lost significance (OR 1.4, 95% confidence interval; 0.8-2.4). Conclusion: Time-to-pregnancy ≥24 months in spontaneously conceived pregnancies is associated with decreased levels of PAPP-A and free β-hCG.","Pregnant women are at high risk of complications and fetal deaths when ill with cholera . However , they have been excluded in most cholera vaccination campaigns because of the lack of safety data on oral cholera vaccines during pregnancy .

We visited all households in Boffa and Koba sub-prefectures , where the vaccination campaign took place , and enrolled a total of 2 , 493 women in the study . In this large retrospective cohort , we found no association between fetal exposure to the cholera vaccine and the risk of pregnancy loss or malformation .

"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a chemical created by trophoblast tissue, tissue typically found in early embryos and which will eventually be part of the placenta. Measuring hCG levels can be helpful in identifying a normal pregnancy, pathologic pregnancy, and can also be useful following an aborted pregnancy. There is also a benefit in measuring hCG in a variety of cancers including choriocarcinoma and extra-uterine malignancies.",DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY : The patient was reportedly a 7 pounds 12 ounces product of an unplanned and uncomplicated pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery .
"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a pregnancy hormone secreted by the placental synctiotrophoblast cell layer that has been linked to fetal growth and various placental, uterine and fetal functions. In order to investigate the effects of hCG on clinical endpoints, knowledge on reference range (RR) methodology and determinants of gestational hCG levels is crucial. Moreover, a better understanding of gestational hCG physiology can improve current screening programs and future clinical management. Serum total hCG levels were determined in 8195 women participating in the Generation R Study. Gestational age specific RRs using 'ultrasound derived gestational age' (US RRs) were calculated and compared with 'last menstrual period derived gestational age' (LMP RRs) and a model-based RR. We also investigated which pregnancy characteristics were associated with hCG levels. Compared to the US RRs, the LMP RRs were lower, most notably for the median and lower limit levels. No considerable differences were found between RRs calculated in the general population or in uncomplicated pregnancies only. Maternal smoking, BMI, parity, ethnicity, fetal gender, placental weight and hyperemesis gravidarum symptoms were associated with total hCG. We provide gestational RRs for total hCG and show that total hCG values and RR cut-offs during pregnancy vary depending on pregnancy dating methodology. This is likely due to the influence of hCG on embryonic growth, suggesting that ultrasound based pregnancy dating might be less reliable in women with high/low hCG levels. Furthermore, we identify different pregnancy characteristics that influence total hCG levels considerably and should therefore be accounted for in clinical studies.","Pregnant women are at high risk of complications and fetal deaths when ill with cholera .

"Family physicians often use quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) testing to assess first-trimester bleeding. While we anticipate a range of normal results for any given week in the first trimester, we predict an approximate doubling over 48 hours in a normal pregnancy during the first trimester. Human chorionic gonadotropin tends to peak at about 10 weeks’ gestation before declining and stabilizing. When HCG levels plateau prematurely or fail to rise as expected, we consider that the pregnancy might not be viable.","A special math function is used to protect data by creating a unique digital fingerprint, so any change to the data would be obvious."
"The first trimester screening programme offers a noninvasive option for the early detection of aneuploidy pregnancies. This screening is done by a combination of two biochemical markers i.e. serum free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free β-hCG) and pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), maternal age and fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness at 11 + 0-13 + 6 weeks of gestation. A beneficial consequence of screening is the early diagnosis or trisomies 21, 18 and 13. At 11 + 0-13 + 6 weeks, the relative prevalence of trisomies 18 and 13 to trisomy 21 are found to be one to three and one to seven, respectively. All three trisomies are associated with increased maternal age, increased fetal NT and decreased PAPP-A, but in trisomy 21 serum free β-hCG is increased whereas in trisomies 18 and 13 free β-hCG is decreased.","International guidelines recommend routine prevention and treatments which are safe and effective during pregnancy to reduce hookworm , malaria and other infections among pregnant women living in geographic areas where these infections are prevalent . Despite their effectiveness , programs to address common infections such as hookworm , schistosomiasis and malaria during pregnancy have not been widely adopted . Hookworm , malaria and other infections have been associated with anemia in children , but the studies on the impact of these infections on anemia in pregnancy have not been as clear . This study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of parasitic infections among women attending antenatal care which provided the nationally recommended malaria preventive treatment program in coastal Kenya . At the first ANC visit , more than 70% of women were anemic , nearly one-fourth had hookworm and about 10% had malaria . Women with high levels of hookworm or malaria infections were at risk of anemia ."
"The comparative absorption of zinc after oral administration of three different complexed forms was studied in 15 healthy human volunteers in a double-blind four-period crossover trial. The individuals were randomly divided into four groups. Each group rotated for four week periods through a random sequence of oral supplementation including: zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, and zinc gluconate (equivalent to 50 mg elemental zinc per day) and placebo. Zinc was measured in hair, urine, erythrocyte and serum before and after each period. At the end of four weeks hair, urine and erythrocyte zinc levels rose significantly (p less than 0.005, p less than 0.001, and p less than 0.001) during zinc picolinate administration. There was no significant change in any of these parameters from zinc gluconate, zinc citrate or placebo administration. There was a small, insignificant rise in serum zinc during zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo supplementation. The results of this study suggest that zinc absorption in humans can be improved by complexing zinc with picolinic acid.",There was no collection of blood

"The anti-VSC (volatile sulphur compounds) effect of zinc is known to be associated with free zinc ions. Objective: To examine whether zinc salts with low stability constants were more suitable as sources of zinc in zinc lozenges than zinc salts with high stability constants. The former provide free zinc ions upon dissolution in water, whereas the latter provide few such ions. Design and participants: Identical lozenges were produced which contained either zinc acetate, zinc gluconate (low stability constants), zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc (extremely high stability constants). All the lozenges contained 0.1 per cent of zinc. A test panel of 10 volunteers used the different lozenges randomly. VSC were measured by GC. Results and conclusion: The lozenge with the highest stability constant was as effective as those with very low stability constants. The anti-VSC effect was thus not related to this constant. These findings may be explained by the possibility that alternative ligands with stronger affinity for zinc than the original ligands in the lozenges may be present in the oral cavity. An in vitro experiment indicated that the sulphide ion (S2-) may be such a ligand.","Plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with complex environments in which resources as well as potential threats are fluctuating .

"Currently much attention has been given to the neurotoxicity of zinc, yet little is known about the influence of the counterions present. Therefore, we investigated the influence of different Zn(2+)-salts (concentrations range 0.05-0.3 mM) on cell viability, ATP and glutathione concentration and caspase activation in differentiated PC12 cells as a model for neuronal cells. Generally, at concentrations of 0.05 mM most Zn(2+)-salts were not cytotoxic except for zinc-citrate. At concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 mM Zn(2+) a significant decrease in GSH and ATP levels preceded cell death induced by all salts, except of zinc-histidinate. Zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate turned out to be the most toxic salts particularly at low concentrations. Analyses of caspase 3/7 activity showed that dependent on the concentration and the type of the salt used cell death may show more or less signs of both, necrosis and apoptosis. Interestingly, the uptake of Zn(2+) from zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate was significantly higher than that of other salts, implicating a correlation between uptake and toxicity. In conclusion, Zn(2+)-salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride(,) zinc-gluconate) and low cytotoxicity (zinc-histidinate).","The latest outbreak of Ebola virus ( EBOV ) in West Africa resulted in more than 28 , 000 human infections including more than 11 , 000 deaths thus highlighting the necessity for the development of countermeasures .

"Background: There is a clinical need for new therapeutic products against Herpes simplex virus (HSV). The pomegranate, fruit of the tree Punica granatum L, has since ancient times been linked to activity against infection. This work probed the activity of pomegranate rind extract (PRE) and co-administered zinc (II) ions. Materials and methods: PRE was used in conjunction with zinc (II) salts to challenge HSV-1 and aciclovir-resistant HSV in terms of virucidal plaque assay reduction and antiviral activities in epithelial Vero host cells. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTS assay using a commercial kit. Results: Zinc sulphate, zinc citrate, zinc stearate and zinc gluconate demonstrated similar potentiated virucidal activity with PRE against HSV-1 by up to 4-fold. A generally parabolic relationship was observed when HSV-1 was challenged with PRE and varying concentrations of ZnSO4, with a maximum potentiation factor of 5.5. Punicalagin had 8-fold greater virucidal activity than an equivalent mass of PRE. However, antiviral data showed that punicalagin had significantly lower antiviral activity compared to the activity of PRE (EC50 = 0.56 μg mL-1) a value comparable to aciclovir (EC50 = 0.18 μg mL-1); however, PRE also demonstrated potency against aciclovir-resistant HSV (EC50 = 0.02 μg mL-1), whereas aciclovir showed no activity. Antiviral action of PRE was not influenced by ZnSO4. No cytotoxicity was detected with any test solution. Conclusions: The potentiated virucidal activity of PRE by coadministered zinc (II) has potential as a multi-action novel topical therapeutic agent against HSV infections, such as coldsores.","Herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) glycoprotein D ( gD2 ) mediates virus entry and cell-to-cell spread .

"The water-soluble zinc salts gluconate, sulfate, and acetate are commonly used as supplements in tablet or syrup form to prevent zinc deficiency and to treat diarrhea in children in combination with oral rehydration. Zinc citrate is an alternative compound with high zinc content, slightly soluble in water, which has better sensory properties in syrups but no absorption data in humans. We used the double-isotope tracer method with (67) Zn and (70) Zn to measure zinc absorption from zinc citrate given as supplements containing 10 mg of zinc to 15 healthy adults without food and compared absorption with that from zinc gluconate and zinc oxide (insoluble in water) using a randomized, double-masked, 3-way crossover design. Median (IQR) fractional absorption of zinc from zinc citrate was 61.3% (56.6-71.0) and was not different from that from zinc gluconate with 60.9% (50.6-71.7). Absorption from zinc oxide at 49.9% (40.9-57.7) was significantly lower than from both other supplements (P < 0.01). Three participants had little or no absorption from zinc oxide. We conclude that zinc citrate, given as a supplement without food, is as well absorbed by healthy adults as zinc gluconate and may thus be a useful alternative for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea. The more insoluble zinc oxide is less well absorbed when given as a supplement without food and may be minimally absorbed by some individuals.","Plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with complex environments in which resources as well as potential threats are fluctuating .

"The water-soluble zinc salts gluconate, sulfate, and acetate are commonly used as supplements in tablet or syrup form to prevent zinc deficiency and to treat diarrhea in children in combination with oral rehydration. Zinc citrate is an alternative compound with high zinc content, slightly soluble in water, which has better sensory properties in syrups but no absorption data in humans. We used the double-isotope tracer method with (67) Zn and (70) Zn to measure zinc absorption from zinc citrate given as supplements containing 10 mg of zinc to 15 healthy adults without food and compared absorption with that from zinc gluconate and zinc oxide (insoluble in water) using a randomized, double-masked, 3-way crossover design. Median (IQR) fractional absorption of zinc from zinc citrate was 61.3% (56.6-71.0) and was not different from that from zinc gluconate with 60.9% (50.6-71.7). Absorption from zinc oxide at 49.9% (40.9-57.7) was significantly lower than from both other supplements (P < 0.01). Three participants had little or no absorption from zinc oxide. We conclude that zinc citrate, given as a supplement without food, is as well absorbed by healthy adults as zinc gluconate and may thus be a useful alternative for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea. The more insoluble zinc oxide is less well absorbed when given as a supplement without food and may be minimally absorbed by some individuals.","Plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with complex environments in which resources as well as potential threats are fluctuating .

"Objective: Zinc supplementation is beneficial in some clinical conditions such as age-related macula degeneration (AMD). It has been suggested that zinc absorption is influenced by the form in which zinc is ingested. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of zinc gluconate (organic) were compared with those of zinc oxide (inorganic). Methods: 12 healthy male subjects aged between 21 and 31 years (24 years median) orally received daily doses of 20 mg metal zinc as zinc gluconate and 17.4 mg metal zinc as zinc oxide under randomized crossover conditions for 14 days each with at least 14 days as a washout. Zinc plasma concentrations were measured by means of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. Results: C(max) was found 18.3% (10.3 - 26.3%) higher following multiple-dose administration of zinc gluconate as compared to zinc oxide (mean; 0.95% confidence interval of the relative differences between both treatment conditions; p < 0.05). AUC(0-24h) was noted 8.1% (1.9 - 14.3%) higher after zinc was given as zinc gluconate when compared to zinc oxide (p < 0.05) whereas t(max) did not differ between both treatment conditions. Conclusions: Zinc absorption in humans could be improved by zinc complexation with gluconate.","Plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with complex environments in which resources as well as potential threats are fluctuating .

"Zinc (Zn)-enriched yeast and gluconate are considered two of the more biologically available supplements. However, there have been few reports comparing the bioavailability of these supplements. The objective of this study was to demonstrate whether Zn was absorbed better by healthy male volunteers when given supplements where the mineral is found organically bound in yeast or as a salt gluconate form. The trial used a randomized, two-way crossover design. Urine, blood, and fecal samples were collected and analyzed over a 48-h period after a single dose of supplement. The net Zn balance and the relative bioavailability were calculated. No differences were observed in urine excretion of the two supplements. Zinc gluconate gave higher Zn concentrations in the blood in the first 6 h but also showed greater losses in the feces. Zinc yeast also increased in blood with time but showed significantly less loss in the feces. Thus, the net Zn balance after 48 h for Zn yeast was 9.46 but for Zn gluconate it was -2.00, indicating that Zn gluconate supplementation contributed to a net loss of Zn. It was concluded that organic Zn yeast supplements are more biologically available than Zn gluconate salts.","Intestinal schistosomiasis is a parasitic water borne neglected tropical disease of considerable public health relevance in the tropics and subtropics .

"Unlike iron, zinc absorption is influenced by dietary zinc intake, not zinc status. As dietary zinc increases, the total amount of absorbed zinc increases while the percent absorbed declines. The gastrointestinal tract maintains whole-body zinc homeostasis by adjusting endogenous zinc losses to the amount absorbed. At intakes below about 9 mg/day, zinc absorption occurs primarily by a saturable (carrier) process involving ZIP4, ZnT1, and other transporters. There is no evidence that past zinc intakes, or status, influences zinc absorption. Instead, current zinc intake is the chief determinant of zinc absorption. Supplemental zinc taken with water in the post-absorptive state initially is absorbed more efficiently than food zinc, but absorption efficiency declines within 24 hours presumably due to down-regulation of the zinc transporters. More research is needed to understand the effect of physiological state on zinc absorption.",There is no evidence of redness

"Zinc has earned recognition recently as a micronutrient of outstanding and diverse biological, clinical, and global public health importance. Regulation of absorption by zinc transporters in the enterocyte, together with saturation kinetics of the absorption process into and across the enterocyte, are the principal means by which whole-body zinc homeostasis is maintained. Several physiologic factors, most notably the quantity of zinc ingested, determine the quantity of zinc absorbed and the efficiency of absorption. Other factors are age and the time over which zinc is ingested. Zinc from supplements has not been shown to be absorbed differently from that taken with meals that lack inhibitors of zinc absorption. The principal dietary factor known to impair zinc bioavailability is inositol hexa- (and penta-) phosphate or phytate. Modeling of zinc absorption as a function of dietary zinc and phytate accounts for >80% of the variability in the quantity of zinc absorbed. Fitting the model to new data has resulted in continual improvement in parameter estimates, which currently indicate a maximal absorption in adults of approximately 6 mg Zn/d and that the average estimated dietary requirement doubles with 1000 mg dietary phytate/d. Intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc is regulated in response to recent absorption and to zinc status. The quantitative relation of intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc to zinc absorption is currently considered to be of major importance in the determination of zinc requirements. The effects of phytate on intestinal losses of endogenous zinc merit further investigation but are probably not of the same magnitude as its inhibitory effects on absorption of exogenous zinc.","Plants have evolved mechanisms to cope with complex environments in which resources as well as potential threats are fluctuating .

"Iron is a micronutrient essential for a wide range of metabolic processes in virtually all living organisms. During infections, a battle for iron takes place between the human host and the invading pathogens. The liver peptide hepcidin, which is phylogenetically and structurally linked to defensins (antimicrobial peptides of the innate immunity), plays a pivotal role by subtracting iron to pathogens through its sequestration into host cells, mainly macrophages. While this phenomenon is well studied in certain bacterial infections, much less is known regarding viral infections. Iron metabolism also has implications on the functionality of cells of the immune system. Once primed by the contact with antigen presenting cells, lymphocytes need iron to sustain the metabolic burst required for mounting an effective cellular and humoral response. The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted an amount of clinical and translational research over the possible influences of nutrients on SARS-CoV-2 infection, in terms of either susceptibility or clinical course. Here we review the intersections between iron metabolism and COVID-19, belonging to the wider domain of the so-called ""nutritional immunity"". A better understanding of such connections has potential broad implications, either from a mechanistic standpoint, or for the development of more effective strategies for managing COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.","Infection with the protozoan parasite Leishmania causes significant human disease in many parts of the world , particularly in the Middle East , India and South America . The parasite is transmitted by sand flies , which are difficult to control and are becoming increasingly common in urban areas . With domestic dogs serving as reservoirs of the disease and global travel increasing the population of infected human patients , the overall burden of leishmaniasis is on the rise . In mammals these parasites replicate inside macrophages , and therefore need strategies to survive within a cell that is specialized in killing pathogens . Earlier work demonstrated that iron is one of the essential nutrients that Leishmania must acquire from host cells to survive . Acquiring iron is particularly challenging inside macrophages , which play an important role in host iron homeostasis and export iron extracellularly through the membrane transporter ferroportin . We found that Leishmania amazonesis induces their host macrophages to produce hepcidin , a peptide that triggers internalization and degradation of ferroportin . This strategy increases the macrophage intracellular iron pool , and stimulates Leishmania replication . These results suggest that defects in iron homeostasis , which occur frequently in the human population , can have an important role in susceptibility to Leishmania infections ."
"Background and aims: Iron is an essential trace element to almost all organism, and the delicate balance between host defend system and viral proliferation plays an important role in infective conditions. While the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory examinations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Results: We identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54-73) and the median length of hospital stay was 28 days (IQR: 17-40). After adjusting for age, sex, IL-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% CI: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% CI: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. These iron indices were also related to the risk of ARDS, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations. Conclusions: Patients with low serum iron status likely suffered from severe condition and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19. The iron metabolism parameters might be risk factors and clinical biomarkers for COVID-19 prognosis.","Tuberculosis ( TB ) , caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and parasitic worm infections are typical diseases of poverty . They often overlap geographically , and can occur in the same individual . Parasitic worm infections contribute to the down-regulation of the essential immune response against TB , and therefore can increase progression from latent M . tuberculosis infection to active TB . We conducted a case-control study in Dar es Salaam , the economic capital of Tanzania , where TB and helminths constitute a considerable burden . We found that infection with the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni was associated with active TB , while none of the other parasitic worms showed such an association . Interestingly , TB patients infected with S . mansoni had significantly lower sputum bacterial load at diagnosis and tended to have fewer lung cavitations compared with TB patients without any parasitic worm infection . Diagnosis and treatment of parasitic worm infections , particularly schistosomiasis , should be considered during the management of TB patients and in the context of TB control programs . This could help to reduce the TB burden in settings where TB and parasitic worms co-exist ."
"Large variability in COVID-19 clinical progression urges the need to find the most relevant biomarkers to predict patients' outcomes. We evaluated iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients admitted to the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with variable clinical pictures, from September to November 2020. One hundred and twenty-seven tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 176 tested negative. Iron-related laboratory parameters and cytokines were determined in blood samples collected soon after admission. Demographic data, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were assigned into five groups according to severity. Serum iron and transferrin levels at admission were lower in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were increased in COVID-19-positive patients. The lowest serum iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were associated with the worst outcomes. Iron levels negatively correlated with IL-6 and higher levels of this cytokine were associated with a worse prognosis. Serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were higher in COVID-19-positive than in COVID-19-negative patients. Serum iron is the simplest laboratory test to be implemented as a predictor of disease progression in COVID-19-positive patients.","Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system and affects the muscles and heart . The disease is caused by a defect in the frataxin gene , which is involved in iron homeostasis and likely protects against reactive oxygen species . In order to identify mechanisms involved in the nature and progression of the disease , we performed transcriptional profiling and measurements of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage on blood cells from FRDA patients . Transcriptional profiling was performed on blood samples from a cohort of 28 children compared to a control group . These data were then validated with a cohort of 14 adults with FRDA compared to a second independent control group . DNA damage was assessed on the blood samples from the 28 FRDA children , plus an additional 19 affected children , by quantitative PCR ( QPCR ) . Transcriptional profiling revealed changes in gene expression consistent with the presence of genotoxic stress in FRDA patients . This finding was supported by the direct evidence that FRDA patients accumulated significantly higher levels of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage as compared to controls . The identification of potential biomarkers , including the DNA damage found in peripheral blood , may help identify therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease ."
"This report provides perspectives concerning dual roles of serum ferritin as a measure of both iron status and inflammation. We suggest benefits of a lower range of serum ferritin as has occurred for total serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels. Observations during a prospective randomized study using phlebotomy in patients with peripheral arterial disease offered unique insights into dual roles of serum ferritin both as an iron status marker and acute phase reactant. Robust positive associations between serum ferritin, interleukin 6 [IL-6], tissue necrosis factor-alpha, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were discovered. Elevated serum ferritin and IL-6 levels associated with increased mortality and with reduced mortality at ferritin levels <100 ng mL-1. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate similar outcomes. Extremely elevated ferritin and IL-6 levels also occur in individuals with high mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disordered iron metabolism reflected by a high range of serum ferritin level signals disease severity and outcomes. Based upon experimental and epidemiologic data, we suggest testing the hypotheses that optimal ferritin levels for cardiovascular mortality reduction range from 20 to 100 ng mL-1 with % transferrin levels from 20 to 50%, to ensure adequate iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng mL-1 associate with all-cause mortality in population cohorts.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) and helminth infections are co-endemic in several regions of the world and their immune responses may be mutually antagonistic . We therefore hypothesized that helminth infection would impact and potentially shape Mtb-specific T-cell responses and systemic inflammation in patients suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) enrolled from two helminth endemic regions i . e . Tanzania ( TZ ) and South Africa ( SA ) . In this study , we demonstrate for the first time that TB patients from SA and TZ harbor distinct immune responses to Mtb antigens . Indeed , we showed that Mtb-specific CD4 T-cell responses of TB patients from TZ were composed by a mixed T helper type 1 ( Th1 ) and Th2 responses . In contrast , the cytokine profile of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells of TB patients from SA was dominated by Th1 cells and associated with TB-induced systemic inflammation and elevated serum levels of type I IFN . Taken together , these data indicate that Mtb-specific T-cell responses are diverse in human populations and can be strongly influenced by host and pathogen genetic background , co-infections and yet unknown environmental factors . Identification of correlates of risk and protection from TB disease will help in the rational development of protective T-cell based vaccines against TB , early monitoring TB treatment outcomes and focused follow up of high risk populations ."
"While it took decades to arrive to a conclusion that ferritin is more than an indicator of iron storage level, it took a short period of time through the COVID-19 pandemic to wonder what the reason behind high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 might be. Unsurprisingly, acute phase reactant was not a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. Ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an acute response to inflammation. However, with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only. In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin. Doubtlessly, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better coping with severe diseases in terms of treatment and prevention of complications. The origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various pathological and clinical processes are presented hereby in our article. In addition, the implications of ferritin in COVID-19 are addressed.","Leptospirosis is a widespread bacterial infection that is transmitted by soil or water contaminated by the urine of infected animals , or directly from these animals . It has highly diverse clinical presentations , making its differential diagnosis difficult . Though most cases are minor and self-resolving , there are also severe forms that include a sepsis pattern and multiple organ failure , and have possible fatal outcomes . Predictors of disease evolution and outcome are scarce , yet they would be very valuable to clinicians as well as to better decipher disease pathogenesis . In this study , we used a hamster model of leptospirosis to evaluate if immune genes were differentially expressed between individuals and if their expression levels could help forecast the outcome of the disease . We found that hamsters that later died from leptospirosis had significantly higher expression levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators compared to survivors . These results suggest that expression levels of these immune effectors might be helpful predictors of outcome in leptospirosis and that septic shock contributes to fatal leptospirosis ."
"SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a protean clinical picture that can range from asymptomatic patients to life-threatening conditions. Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe pulmonary involvement and develop neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and strikingly elevated levels of IL-6. There is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia leading to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still's disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. Numerous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained inflammatory process. High levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. Iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. In addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic activity. Herein, we analyse the pathogenic role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion therapy as a novel therapeutic approach in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Novel detection and sequencing technologies have greatly improved our knowledge of virus diversity in nature . Metaviromic screening of zoonotic animal reservoirs has become an established approach in pathogen surveillance and pandemic preparedness research . However , knowledge of viral genomes and host-associated viromes is insufficient to predict zoonotic spillover events of reservoir-borne viruses . Phenotypic characterization of important viral functions will be necessary to identify virulence traits that determine the potential of viral emergence . As proof-of-principle , the present study demonstrates relevant functional differences between one of the main host immune antagonists of bat-borne viruses that belong to the same virus species as the epidemic agent of SARS . The antagonist , the papain-like protease , shows double action against IFN-mediated antiviral effects in epidemic SARS-coronavirus ( binding and processing of ubiquitin ) , whereas the homologous protein in bat-borne viruses has only the processing function . This finding is surprising as the papain-like protease is a highly conserved protein domain that was not expected to vary among conspecific coronaviruses . PLP function may represent a variable virulence trait among reservoir-borne viruses . The preformed virulence of the primordial genetic lineage may have supported the emergence of SARS-CoV as a human epidemic agent ."
"Background: Several studies have suggested that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can affect several organs, including the brain. In the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause dyshomeostasis of some trace elements that promote complex biochemical reactions in specialized neurological functions. Objective: Understand the neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship between trace elements and neurological disorders after infection, and provide new insights on the drug development for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: The main databases were used to search studies published up September 2021, focusing on the role of trace elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain. Results: The imbalance of important trace elements can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 neurovirulence and increase the neurotoxicity since many neurological processes can be associated with the homeostasis of metal and metalloproteins. Some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the synapse as a vulnerable region of the brain to neurological disorders after viral infection. Considering the combined evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the relationship between neurological disorders and imbalance of trace elements in the brain after viral infection. Conclusion: Trace elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies, and inhibit virus replication. However, the relationship between trace elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements remain largely undefined. Therefore, there is still a lot to be explored to understand the biochemical mechanisms involved between trace elements and viral infections, especially in the brain.","Novel detection and sequencing technologies have greatly improved our knowledge of virus diversity in nature . Metaviromic screening of zoonotic animal reservoirs has become an established approach in pathogen surveillance and pandemic preparedness research . However , knowledge of viral genomes and host-associated viromes is insufficient to predict zoonotic spillover events of reservoir-borne viruses . Phenotypic characterization of important viral functions will be necessary to identify virulence traits that determine the potential of viral emergence . As proof-of-principle , the present study demonstrates relevant functional differences between one of the main host immune antagonists of bat-borne viruses that belong to the same virus species as the epidemic agent of SARS . The antagonist , the papain-like protease , shows double action against IFN-mediated antiviral effects in epidemic SARS-coronavirus ( binding and processing of ubiquitin ) , whereas the homologous protein in bat-borne viruses has only the processing function . This finding is surprising as the papain-like protease is a highly conserved protein domain that was not expected to vary among conspecific coronaviruses . PLP function may represent a variable virulence trait among reservoir-borne viruses . The preformed virulence of the primordial genetic lineage may have supported the emergence of SARS-CoV as a human epidemic agent ."
"The importance of ferritin as an inflammatory marker is well recognized. However, it is unknown whether this differs between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients. The blood levels of ferritin, white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase may all be measured to check whether there is a difference. The researchers want to see if the inflammatory process changes between these two kinds (LDH). Methodology: Blood samples were collected from 119 COVID-19 patients in the hospital and 50 healthy persons. Corona virus was discovered when a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested using the RT-PCR technique. Ferritin, LDH, WBC, and CRP were also tested using Min Vidus, AccEnT 200, Ruby system, and Latx in that sequence. The study revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher levels of ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH in their blood than healthy people, with values of 539,08 ng/mL, 44.7109/L, 22.95 mg/L, and 403.95 U/L for COVID-19 patients versus 77.103 ng/mL, 4.9.4109/L, 6.53 mg/L, and 171.56 U/L for healthy people. According to the existing data, males are more likely to be infected with COVID-19 (81%) than females (32%), and females had greater ferritin, CRP, WBC, and LDH levels than males. Because they are related to an optimum test for predicting COVID-19 infection, the recommended cut-off values for ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH are 109.8 ng/mL, 14.9109/L, 10.15 mg/L, and 229.33 U/L, respectively. Finally, an increase in ferritin levels in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 is linked to an increase in inflammatory markers including CRP, WBC, and LDH, which may assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.","The effect of a genetic mutation can depend on the genotype of the organism in which it occurs . For example , a mutation that is beneficial in one genetic background might be neutral or even deleterious in another . The interactions between genes that cause this dependence—known as epistasis—play an important role in many evolutionary theories . However , they are difficult to study and remain poorly understood . We used a novel approach to examine the evolution of interactions arising between a key regulatory gene , crp , and mutations that occurred during the adaptation of a bacterium , Escherichia coli , to a laboratory environment . To do this , we measured the effect of deleting crp on the expression of all genes in the organism , providing a sensitive measure to identify new interactions involving this gene . We found that deleting crp had a dramatic and parallel effect on gene expression in two independently evolved populations , but much less effect in their ancestor . An analysis of these changes identified a number of regulatory genes as candidates for harboring beneficial mutations that could account for the parallel changes . These findings indicate that epistasis has played an important role in the evolution of these populations , and they provide insight into the types of genetic changes through which epistasis can evolve ."
"Ferritin, which includes twenty-four light and heavy chains in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body's iron metabolism. Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL-1 in men and between 30-300 ngmL-1 in women. Iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immunomodulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers. When ferritin level exceeds 1000 µgL-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia. Iron chelators such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload. The inflammation cascade and poor prognosis of COVID-19 may be attributed to high ferritin levels. Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron chelator administered orally at 20-40 mgkg-1 once daily, as well as intravenous deferoxamine at 1000 mg initially followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 hours. It can be combined with monoclonal antibodies, antioxidants, corticosteroids, and lactoferrin to make iron chelation therapy effective for COVID-19 victims. In this article, we analyze the antiviral and antifibrotic activity of iron chelators, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a potentially innovative treatment strategy for COVID-19.","The patient is on vasopressors due to ventilator support , bronchodilators as well as intravenous antibiotics ."
"During infections, the host redistributes iron in order to starve pathogens from this nutrient. Several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage. Ferritin is the most important iron storage protein. It is composed of variable proportions of two peptides, the L- and H-ferritins (FTL and FTH). We previously showed that macrophages increase their expression of FTH1 when they are infected in vitro with Mycobacterium avium, without a significant increase in FTL. In this work, we investigated the role of macrophage FTH1 in M. avium infection in vivo. We found that mice deficient in FTH1 in myeloid cells are more resistant to M. avium infection, presenting lower bacterial loads and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type littermates, due to the lower levels of available iron in the tissues. Importantly, we also found that FTH1 produced by myeloid cells in response to infection may be found in circulation and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution. Specifically, in the absence of FTH1 in myeloid cells, increased expression of ferroportin is observed in liver granulomas and increased iron accumulation occurs in hepatocytes. These results highlight the importance of FTH1 expression in myeloid cells for iron redistribution during infection.","Infection with the protozoan parasite Leishmania causes significant human disease in many parts of the world , particularly in the Middle East , India and South America . The parasite is transmitted by sand flies , which are difficult to control and are becoming increasingly common in urban areas . With domestic dogs serving as reservoirs of the disease and global travel increasing the population of infected human patients , the overall burden of leishmaniasis is on the rise . In mammals these parasites replicate inside macrophages , and therefore need strategies to survive within a cell that is specialized in killing pathogens . Earlier work demonstrated that iron is one of the essential nutrients that Leishmania must acquire from host cells to survive . Acquiring iron is particularly challenging inside macrophages , which play an important role in host iron homeostasis and export iron extracellularly through the membrane transporter ferroportin . We found that Leishmania amazonesis induces their host macrophages to produce hepcidin , a peptide that triggers internalization and degradation of ferroportin . This strategy increases the macrophage intracellular iron pool , and stimulates Leishmania replication . These results suggest that defects in iron homeostasis , which occur frequently in the human population , can have an important role in susceptibility to Leishmania infections ."

Exploring how Drosophila form long-lasting memories of certain experiences , we have found that antimicrobial peptides that fight bacteria in the body , are expressed in the head , and control whether an animal will form long-term memory of a food source or an unsuccessful mating experience . Antimicrobial peptides are detected in the brain of many species and has often been associated with dysfunction of the nervous system . This and other recent works , provide an explanation to why antimicrobial peptides may be expressed in the head: they regulate normal functions of the brain . Both eating , and mating engage the immune system in preparation of exposure to external agents including bacteria . We speculate antimicrobial peptides were upregulated in the body to deal with immune challenges and over evolutionary time some of them are co-adopted to activate signaling pathways to convey specific information to the nervous system ."

The pandemic's effects on the global economy were unprecedented.,"Infections caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus have increased significantly over the last two decades , with cases now regularly reported globally . The emergence of cholera at global scale has brought the attention toward other Vibrio diseases in developing countries . This was the situation in Peru , where the investigation of V . cholerae in hospitals and regional public health laboratories after the dramatic emergence of cholera epidemic in 1991 enabled the identification of other pathogenic Vibrio throughout the whole country . The submission of all these bacteria to the Instituto Nacional de Salud ( INS , Lima , Peru ) for characterization generated an extraordinary repository of records and isolates which have been decisive for sizing the impact of V . parahaemolyticus infections on the population .

"However , several groups have reported that the number of influenza virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells in the lung airways of mice declines over time corresponding with a loss of heterosubtypic protection [26]–[29] .","Cytomegalovirus induces a lifelong infection in the majority of the world's population , due to the ability of the virus to establish latency . Upon CMV infection , large numbers of effector memory T cells are induced in peripheral tissues , a process that is termed memory inflation . As inflationary T cells are highly functional , CMV-based vaccines have gained substantial interest for vaccination purposes . Here we examine factors that promote and limit memory T cell inflation . We found that there were no constraints on the availability of specific niches for inflationary T cells in tissues and that high avidity T cells predominately contribute to the inflationary T cell population in the beginning of infection . Moreover , the number of early primed KLRG1- CMV-specific T cells in the acute phase of infection set the limit for memory T cell inflation . Furthermore , we show that inflationary T cells provided protection from a pathogenic challenge in peripheral tissues such as the ovaries . Thus , inflationary T cells comprise a population of T cells that can protect peripheral tissues from pathogenic infections and their efficacy can be regulated by balancing the number of KLRG1- CMV-specific cells during priming ."

We subsequently determined if glycine or 5-Ala could increase the level of hemoglobin in a more complex vertebrate model of CSA .,"Currently , a major public health concern is the next influenza pandemic; yet it remains unclear how to control such a crisis . By using novel mathematical modeling techniques , here we predict the likely impact of voluntary vaccination programs on controlling influenza epidemics and pandemics . We construct an individual-level model of human cognition and behavior that includes two important biological characteristics: memory and adaptability/flexibility . In each influenza season , each individual in the modeled population decides , using memory and adaptability/flexibility , whether to be vaccinated or not . We combine our individual-level model with an epidemic model to predict the impact of voluntary vaccination programs . We found that severe influenza epidemics cannot be prevented unless vaccination programs offer incentives . Frequency of severe epidemics could be reduced if programs provide , as an incentive to be vaccinated , several years of free vaccines to individuals who pay for one year of vaccination . However , we found that a public health intervention program that focuses on vaccinating families is likely to increase the frequency of severe epidemics . Most importantly , we found that individuals' memories and adaptability/flexibility in decision-making are critical factors in determining the success of influenza vaccination programs . Our results are applicable both for the control of seasonal and pandemic influenza ."
"Overall , while the route of priming may have some impact , these results indicate that the magnitude of the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response alone might not be a major determinate of protection against influenza viral challenge and suggest that other factors could be responsible for protection against influenza virus in X31-GP33 immune mice .","Influenza viruses , including H5N1 bird influenza viruses continue to form a major threat for public health . Available antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza are effective to a limited extent and the emergence of resistant viruses may further undermine their use . The symptoms associated with influenza are caused by replication of the virus in the respiratory tract and the host immune response . Here , we report that a molecule of the fibrinolytic system , plasminogen , contributes to inflammation caused by influenza . Inhibiting the action of plasminogen protected mice from severe influenza infections , including those caused by H5N1 and H1N1 pandemic 2009 viruses and may be a promising novel strategy to treat influenza ."

"JAR1 ( At2g46370 ) , encoding an enzyme that synthesizes the active JA-Ile , did not show statistically different expression between wild-type and mutant flowers .","Mobile genetic elements , particularly early transposons ( ETn ) , cause malformations by inserting within genes leading to disruption of exons , splicing or polyadenylation . Few mutagenic early transposon insertions have been found outside genes and the effects of such insertions on surrounding gene regulation is poorly understood . We discovered a novel intergenic ETnII-β insertion in the mouse mutant Polypodia ( Ppd ) . We reproduced the mutant phenotype after engineering the mutation in wild-type cells with homologous recombination , proving that this early transposon insertion is Ppd . Mutant mice are not born in expected Mendelian ratios secondary to loss after E9 . 5 . Embryonic stem cells from mutant mice show upregulated transcription of an adjacent gene , Dusp9 . Thus , at an early and critical stage of development , dysregulated gene transcription is one consequence of the insertion mutation . DNA methylation of the ETn 5′ LTR is not correlated with phenotypic outcome in mutant mice . Polypodia is an example of an intergenic mobile element insertion in mice causing dramatic morphogenetic defects and fetal death ."

"In leaves , jasmonate induces genes encoding enzymes in the jasmonate biosynthesis pathway , indicating that a positive feedback loop amplifies jasmonate synthesis [7] , [8] , [47] , [51]–[54] .","Learning and memory in the brain are thought to be mediated through Hebbian plasticity . When a group of neurons is repetitively active together , their connections get strengthened . This can cause co-activation even in the absence of the stimulus that triggered the change . To avoid run-away behavior it is important to prevent neurons from forming excessively strong connections . This is achieved by regulatory homeostatic mechanisms that constrain the overall activity . Here we study the stability of background activity in a recurrent network model with a plausible Hebbian learning rule and homeostasis . We find that the activity in our model is unstable unless homeostasis reacts to rate changes on a timescale of minutes or faster . Since this timescale is incompatible with most known forms of homeostasis , this implies the existence of a previously unknown , rapid homeostatic regulatory mechanism capable of either gating the rate of plasticity , or affecting synaptic efficacies otherwise on a short timescale ."
"AOS , LOX2 , JAZ5 , and JAZ7 were also underexpressed in arf6-2 arf8-3 myb21-4 triple mutant flowers ( Figure S1C ) , indicating that jasmonate overproduction in myb21 mutant flowers also depends on ARF6 and ARF8 .","Identifying the genetic variation driving plant adaptation to salinity is critical for understanding natural selection and evolutionary mechanisms . In this study , we have revealed that the gene AtHKT1 drives natural variation in the adaptation of A . thaliana to salinity . Our evidences directly show that the AtHKT1 allele in the coastal accession Tsu-1 endows A . thaliana with enhanced adaptability to salinity . Our further experiments have demonstrated that the enhanced adaptability of the coastal accession is attributed to high AtHKT1 expression in stems , leading to low sodium levels in flowers . Our work not only elucidates the role of AtHKT1 in local adaptation to salinity but also improves our understanding of salt tolerance mechanisms of plants ."
"The phenotypic and gene expression analyses presented here show that , in addition to previously described petal , stamen , and gynoecium growth and maturation [2] , [3] , the ARF6 and ARF8 regulatory network promotes nectary development and floral scent production .","Most of our food comes from fruits and seeds , derived from a fertilized gynoecium . Therefore , understanding the mechanisms that control gynoecium development is of crucial importance . The Arabidopsis gynoecium has two fused carpels , with a medial domain between them , and a lateral domain consisting of the carpel walls . All the tissues that are involved in reproduction arise from the carpel margin meristem in the medial domain . The phytohormone cytokinin provides meristematic activity to cells , and interestingly , in a young gynoecium , the medial , but not the lateral , domain presents strong cytokinin signaling . One question that comes to mind is how this pattern is defined . This work demonstrates that the transcription factor SPATULA enables cytokinin signaling at the medial domain , while cytokinin signaling repressors are present in the lateral domain . A second question is whether and how cytokinin in the medial domain communicates with auxin , an important phytohormone for tissue differentiation . We found that cytokinin and SPT activate auxin biosynthesis and transport genes . The integration of these findings gives the first gene regulatory network acting during early gynoecium development . This network is most likely conserved in flowering plants , and can provide insights of molecular processes that are key for food production ."

We hypothesized three scenarios to ameliorate the defect in heme synthesis in hem25Δ cells,"Total body iron stores in mammals is a composite of iron absorption from diet and iron recycled by macrophages from dying red blood cells ( RBCs ) . Upon erythrophagocytosis of RBCs , the hemoglobin is degraded and heme is imported from the phagosomal compartment into the cytoplasm so that the iron can be released from heme . Defects in these pathways can lead to aberrant iron homeostasis . The Heme Responsive Gene-1 ( HRG1 , SLC48A1 ) was identified previously as a heme importer in the intestine of the roundworm , Caenorhabditis elegans . In cell culture studies , HRG1 was demonstrated to mobilize heme from the erythrophagosome of mouse macrophages into the cytosol . However , the in vivo function of HRG1 remains to be elucidated . The zebrafish is a powerful genetic animal model for studying vertebrate development and ontogeny of hematopoiesis . In zebrafish , the kidney marrow is the adult hematopoietic organ that is functionally analogous to the mammalian bone marrow . In this study , we show that Hrg1 plays an essential in vivo role in recycling of damaged RBCs , and that the kidney macrophages are primarily responsible for recycling heme-iron in the adult zebrafish ."

"Inactivation of the GLY1 gene , encoding cytoplasmic threonine aldolase , reduced cellular heme by 75% and glycine mass by 90% ( Fig 4B ) .","Tissue-specific and mutually exclusive alternative pre–mRNA splicing is a challenging model for elucidating regulation mechanisms . We previously demonstrated that evolutionarily conserved RBFOX family RNA–binding proteins ASD-1 and FOX-1 and a muscle-specific RNA–binding protein SUP-12 cooperatively direct muscle-specific selection of exon 5B of the C . elegans egl-15 gene . Here we demonstrate that two sets of mutually exclusive exons , 4a–4c and 7a–7b , of the unc-32 gene are regulated in tissue-specific manners and that ASD-1 and FOX-1 , expressed in a variety of tissues , can regulate the neuron-specific selection of unc-32 exon 7a in combination with the neuron-specific CELF family RNA–binding protein UNC-75 . We determine the cis-elements for the RBFOX family and UNC-75 , which separately reside in intron 7b and intron 7a , respectively . By analyzing the partially spliced RNA species , we propose the orders of intron removal and the sites of action for the RBFOX family and UNC-75 in the mutually exclusive selection of exon 7a and exon 7b . We also demonstrate that UNC-75 regulates the neuron-specific selection of exon 4b and propose the models of the mutually exclusive selection of exons 4a , 4b , and 4c . These studies thus provide novel modes of regulation for tissue-specific and mutually exclusive alternative splicing in vivo ."
"We therefore tested whether priming with another CD8 epitope shared between X31-GP33 and PR8-GP33 , the dominant Db-restricted NP366-374 ( NP366 ) epitope from influenza virus nucleoprotein , could elicit better protection than the GP33 response .","Vaccines against influenza typically induce immune responses based on antibodies , small molecules that recognize the virus particles outside of cells and neutralize them before they infect a cell .

The mice rechallenged with influenza virus 8 days after initial priming displayed delayed morbidity with the initiation of weight loss on ∼day 6 post rechallenge rather than at ∼day 2–3 in naïve mice ( Fig . 2B ) .,"Recently , a 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus was isolated from an immune compromised patient , with antiviral resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor class of drugs . This virus had an amino acid change in the viral neuraminidase enzyme; an isoleucine at position 223 was substituted for an arginine ( I223R ) . Patients infected with a pandemic virus that is resistant to all neuraminidase inhibitors , would leave physicians without antiviral treatment options , since these viruses are naturally resistant to the other class of antivirals , the adamantanes . To date , it is unknown if this I223R mutant virus is affected in its ability to cause severe disease and to transmit to other humans . Therefore , we have addressed this question by comparing the I223R mutant virus with a wild type reference virus in a ferret pathogenicity and transmission model . We found that the I223R mutant virus was not severely affected in its pathogenicity , although fewer lung lesions and alveolitis scores were found for the I223R mutant virus . In addition , we demonstrated that this virus transmitted efficiently to naïve ferrets . Consequently , we conclude that this I223R mutant virus has the potential to cause disease and may spread among humans . Therefore , influenza surveillance for this resistance pattern is advised ."
"In contrast , the LCMV Armstrong immunized mice , despite generating a robust GP33-specific CD8+ T cell response , exhibited little if any protection from the PR8-GP33 rechallenge .","Vaccines against influenza typically induce immune responses based on antibodies , small molecules that recognize the virus particles outside of cells and neutralize them before they infect a cell .

"To determine if the difference in protection between the X31-GP33 and LCMV Armstrong immune groups was due to the X31-GP33 immune mice having a larger influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell response , we quantified the total immune response in these mice 6 days after rechallenge in the lung , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , and spleen .","Patients who succumbed to influenza during the 1918 pandemic had severe lung pathology marked by extensive inflammatory infiltrate , indicating a robust immune response in the lung . Similar findings have been reported from H5N1-infected patients , raising the question as to why people expire in the presence of a strong immune response . We addressed this question by characterizing the immune cell populations in the mouse lung following infection with the 1918 pandemic virus and two H5N1 viruses isolated from fatal cases . Our data shows excessive immune cell infiltration in the lungs contributing to severe consolidation and tissue architecture destruction in mice infected with highly pathogenic ( HP ) influenza viruses , supporting the histopathological observations of lung tissue from 1918 and H5N1 fatalities . We found that certain cells of the innate immune system , specifically macrophages and neutrophils , increase significantly into the mouse lung shortly following HP virus infection . Interestingly , lung macrophages and dendritic cells were shown to be susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 virus infection in vitro or ex vivo , suggesting a possible mechanism of immunopathogenesis . Identification of the precise inflammatory cells associated with lung inflammation will be important for the development of treatments that could potentially enhance or modulate host innate immune responses ."
"Similar results were obtained using mice immunized intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) with LCMV Armstrong ( Fig .

Recent attempts at vaccinating against HIV have relied on the induction of specific antiviral killer T lymphocytes but have failed to confer protection on the host . Better knowledge about how a successful defense should operate is therefore essential for developing and refining new vaccines . Here , we have used a prototypic mouse model to investigate basic defense mechanisms required to eliminate persisting viruses . Experiments in several genetically engineered mouse models show that contrary to common belief , not only antiviral killer T cells , but also antibodies ( produced by B cells ) , are needed to prevent a virus from persisting in its host . These findings suggest that induction of antibodies , along with antiviral killer T lymphocytes , should be envisaged when devising new strategies for vaccinating against HIV or HCV ."
"As Gly1 produces glycine in the cytoplasm , this is consistent with a cytoplasmic source of glycine being the main contributor to heme synthesis through its import by the mitochondrial SLC25A38/Hem25 glycine transporters for subsequent use as substrate in the first enzymatic step in the synthesis of heme catalyzed by ALAS2/Hem1 .","Total body iron stores in mammals is a composite of iron absorption from diet and iron recycled by macrophages from dying red blood cells ( RBCs ) .

"This was based on the metabolic pathway whereby serine , once imported into the mitochondria , can be converted to glycine by mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( Shm1 ) for subsequent use by ALAS2 ( Hem1 in yeast ) to initiate heme synthesis ( Figs 1A and 4A ) .","Cellular suicide is an effective host defense mechanism to control viral infection . Host cells encode proteins that induce infected cell death while viruses encode proteins that prevent death and facilitate viral replication . Human cytomegalovirus encodes vMIA to suppress host-initiated death pathways . Cytomegalovirus infection is controlled by the evolutionarily ancient mitochondrial serine protease , HtrA2/Omi . HtrA2/Omi levels rise dramatically within mitochondria at late times during viral infection , eventually overcoming viral control of a cell death pathway that is dependent on this serine protease and independent of the well-studied apoptotic cell death pathway that conventionally depends upon a class of proteases called caspases . vMIA naturally counteracts HtrA2/Omi-dependent cell death and allows infected cells to survive and produce virus for several days . The natural inhibitory role of vMIA can be overwhelmed by overexpression of HtrA2/Omi in virus-infected cells , but uninfected cells are insensitive to HtrA2/Omi-induced death . The broad distribution of HtrA2/Omi within mammalian host species suggests this may represent an ancient antiviral response or a process of viral detente that establishes the timing of infection . Either way , the success of cytomegalovirus rests in the balance between cell death initiation and the viral cell death suppressor vMIA ."
"To further investigate if Hem25 could be a serine transporter , we took advantage of the fact that it has been reported that shm1Δ cells grow with rates similar to wild type cells whereas shm2Δ cells exhibit a growth impairment associated with a shortage of one-carbon units that can be alleviated by formate supplementation ( formate is transported between the mitochondria and cytoplasm as part of the folate cycle ( Fig 2C ) [15] .","A shortage of workers and coffins, meant hospitals, mortuaries and undertakers were overwhelmed."

The ability of each single and double mutant to synthesize heme in the presence of glycine or 5-Ala was determined .,"The relationship between genotype and phenotype is one of the major challenges in biology . While many previous studies have identified genes involved in complex genetic diseases , there is still a gap between genotype and phenotype . One of the difficulties in filling this gap has been attributed to genetic interactions .

Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed for different genetic interaction types . However , differences in occurrence and underlying molecular mechanism of genetic interactions have not yet been compared between gene classes of different function . Here , we compared genetic interaction patterns identified using gene expression profiling for two classes of genes: gene specific transcription factors and signaling related genes . We modelled all possible molecular networks to unravel putative molecular differences underlying different genetic interaction patterns . Our study proposes a new mechanistic explanation for a certain genetic interaction pattern that is more strongly associated with transcription factors compared to signaling related genes . Overall , our findings and the computational methodologies implemented here can be valuable for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic interactions ."

"Gene deletions were transfered from the BY4741 strains into the W303 background by PCR amplification of the corresponding selectable marker disrupted gene flanked at both ends by ~0 . 2 Kb of yeast genomic DNA , followed by transformation of W303 yeast cells and selection and characterization of transformants for the gene deletion by genomic PCR .","Transfer RNAs are an important component of the translation machinery . Despite extensive biochemical investigations , a systems-level investigation of tRNAs' functional roles in physiology , and genetic interactions among them , is lacking . We created a comprehensive tRNA deletion library in yeast and assessed the essentiality of each tRNA in multiple conditions . The majority of tRNA deletions showed no appreciable fitness defect when such strains were grown on rich medium . More challenging environmental conditions , however , revealed a richer set of specific-tRNA phenotypic defects . Co-deletion of tRNA combinations revealed that tRNAs with essential function can be compensated by members of the same or different anti-codon families . We often saw that identical tRNA gene copies contribute deferentially to fitness , suggesting that the genomic context of each gene can affect functionality . Genome-wide expression changes in response to tRNA deletions revealed two different responses . When a deleted tRNA belongs to a family which contains multiple genes with the same anti-codon , the affected cells responded by up-regulating the translation machinery , but upon deletion of singleton tRNAs , the cellular response resembled that of proteotoxic stress . Our tRNA deletion library is a unique resource that paves the way towards fully characterizing the tRNA pool and their role in cell physiology ."
The DNA sequence of the SLC25A38 open reading frame was confirmed by Sanger sequencing .,"This report describes the identification and characterization of a novel protein of unknown function encoded by a mouse virus genetically similar to human noroviruses .

Its expression enables MNV-1 to establish efficient infection of its natural host through interference with interferon-mediated response pathways and apoptosis .

Cell extracts were subjected to amino acid quantification using the Biochrom 30 Amino Acid Analyzer .,"The mosquito midgut microbiota plays an important role in mosquito susceptibility to human pathogens and therefore is an important component of mosquito disease transmission . The microbiota can be highly variable , however , and the sources of this variation are not well understood . In this work , we aimed to improve our understanding of the ways in which the mosquito can influence its microbiota . To do this , we utilized strains of Aedes aegypti that vary in their midgut microbial load . We compared the transcriptomes of two strains with highly disparate bacterial loads , and found that genes involved in amino acid metabolism ( specifically branched chain amino acid degradation ) were differentially regulated between the strains . We found that when we silenced these genes using an RNA interference approach , bacterial loads increased in a strain-specific manner , confirming a role for these genes in controlling proliferation of the midgut microbiota . Overall , these results suggest that differences in amino acid metabolism or catabolism in the mosquito could have important implications for the mosquito microbiota ."
The protection from morbidity in the mice challenged 8 days after boosting was not due simply to elevated bystander inflammation as mice subjected to two other prime-boost strategies that lacked CD8+ T cells specific for influenza virus showed rapid weight loss ( Fig . 2C ) .,"Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-β ) is a multifunctional protein that serves as a global regulator of immunity by controlling the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses . A pathogen that can regulate TGF-β activation could promote an immune-privileged state for itself within its host . Indeed , multiple parasitic , bacterial , and fungal pathogens successfully evade immune responses by regulating TGF-β . We demonstrate that the neuraminidase proteins from influenza A viruses and Clostridium perfringens convert biologically inactive TGF-β to its active form . Importantly , modulation of TGF-β activity during influenza infection affects viral titers and disease outcome in mice , suggesting that TGF-β plays an important role in influenza pathogenesis , particularly in protecting the host during infection . These studies suggest that neuraminidases from diverse microbes may be able to directly regulate TGF-β , which may in turn play an important role in disease ."
"Furthermore , the lack of weight loss achieved by the virus-specific prime-boost strategy was recapitulated when LM-GP33 was substituted with VV-GP33 ( Fig . 2C ) , suggesting that the lack of weight loss in these mice is not dependent on the identity of the priming agent , but on the rapid initiation of an influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell response .","CD8+ T lymphocytes mediate immunity to intracellular pathogens by killing infected cells . However , some pathogens are able to evade the response of CD8+ T cells and , thus , establish chronic infections . This is the case of Trypanosoma cruzi , the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease . Here , we investigated the basis of the suboptimal response of CD8+ T cells during T . cruzi infection . We observed that cells incubated with the parasite and then adoptively transferred into mice are able to convert an optimal in vivo response of transgenic CD8+ T cells specific to an unrelated epitope into suboptimal . The mechanism of this disturbance relies on the induction of regulatory CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells that interfere with the priming of CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells . These findings illustrate the involvement of regulatory T cells in the regulation of CD8+ T cell priming and contribute to understand how T . cruzi evades host immunity to establish a chronic infection ."
"We next investigated whether we could achieve enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated protection using adoptive transfer strategies analogous to adoptive transfer approaches used for influenza virus-specific CD4+ T cells [35] , [36] .","The 17D line yellow fever virus ( YFV ) vaccines are some of the safest and most effective live-attenuated virus vaccines ever produced , protecting recipients for life against deadly yellow fever ( YF ) . As a testament to this safety and efficacy , the 17D line of live-attenuated vaccines has become an important model for the design of future vaccines . However , we still lack a fundamental understanding of the protective immunity elicited against the virulent YFV , a knowledge gap that must be overcome to inform the design of future live-attenuated and subunit vaccines . Humans develop robust antibody and T cell responses following vaccination , leading some to suggest that vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells are important for protection against virulent YFV . Since this can never be tested in humans , we have used mice to model immunity to the 17D-204 vaccine strain . We found that CD4+ T cells elicited by 17D-204 contributed to protection against virulent YFV , but CD8+ T cells had no effect on the outcomes of survival or disease . Our study is the first to demonstrate that vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cells can protect against YFV infection . These results suggest that vaccine developers should consider the importance of CD4+ T cells when designing vaccines against viruses similar to YFV ."
"On day 8 following the boost , CD8+ T cells were isolated and 0 . 8×106 , or 1 . 6×106 GP33+ CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred to Ly5 . 2+ naïve mice .","CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are critical for controlling many infections . To generate a T cell response during infection , T cells must encounter the microbial peptides that they recognize bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of other cells , such as dendritic cells . It is currently unclear how dendritic cells acquire the antigens they present to T cells during infection with many intracellular pathogens . It is possible that these antigens are phagocytosed and processed by dendritic cells , or antigens may be presented by cells that are infected by pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii , which invades host cells independently of phagocytosis . To differentiate these pathways , we developed a novel technique to track the fate of T . gondii in vivo that distinguishes actively infected cells from those that phagocytosed parasites . This technique was used to examine each of these cell populations . We also used pharmacological inhibitors of parasite invasion , and the transfer of sort-purified infected or uninfected dendritic cells and macrophages to determine what roles phagocytosis and active invasion have in the initiation of T cell responses . Our results demonstrate that phagocytosis of parasites is not sufficient to induce CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responses , whereas infected cells are critical for this process ."

We found that there were no constraints on the availability of specific niches for inflationary T cells in tissues and that high avidity T cells predominately contribute to the inflationary T cell population in the beginning of infection . Moreover , the number of early primed KLRG1- CMV-specific T cells in the acute phase of infection set the limit for memory T cell inflation . Furthermore , we show that inflationary T cells provided protection from a pathogenic challenge in peripheral tissues such as the ovaries . Thus , inflationary T cells comprise a population of T cells that can protect peripheral tissues from pathogenic infections and their efficacy can be regulated by balancing the number of KLRG1- CMV-specific cells during priming ."

The incidence of T1R differs widely from 6% to 67% of leprosy patients in different leprosy endemic settings . Whether or not this reflects the impact of unknown environmental triggers or differences in the genetic background across ethnicities is not known . We performed a comparative transcriptome analysis between leprosy patients affected and free of T1R in response to M . leprae antigens . As the discovery sample we enrolled cured leprosy patients who had been diagnosed with T1R at the time of leprosy diagnosis and leprosy patients who had never undergone T1R ( retrospective arm ) . Whole genome transcriptome analysis after stimulation of blood with M . leprae antigen resulted in the definition of a T1R signature gene set . We validated the T1R gene set in RNA samples obtained from T1R-free patients at the time of leprosy diagnosis and followed for 3 years for development of T1R ( prospective arm ) . These results confirm the role of innate factors in T1R and are a first step towards a predictive genetic T1R signature .

These newly formed merozoites are then released into the bloodstream where they infect red blood cells and cause the symptoms of the disease . Although asymptomatic , the liver stage of malaria is an obligatory step in the parasite's lifecycle and constitutes an appealing target for prophylatic intervention . The marked tropism of sporozoites for hepatocytes suggests the latter may provide the parasite with a molecular environment that it can exploit to its own benefit . The identification of host factors that influence hepatic infection can thus provide clues for potential anti-malarial strategies . To this end , we carried out an RNA interference screen of the entire human kinome and associated signaling molecules and assessed the effect of knockdown of their expression in the infection of a human hepatoma cell line by Plasmodium . This strategy identified at least 5 kinases whose down-regulation leads to a marked decrease in infection . Further characterisation of one of these proteins , PKCζ , confirmed that it plays a role in infection by influencing the parasite's invasion of the host liver cells ."

In the present study , we found differences in T-cell reactivity in the two models . However , both models exhibited an imbalance in IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 . The requirement for formation of the IL-12p70 dimer in prevention of demyelination was supported by adoptive transfer experiments . These results suggest a pathological role for macrophages in these models of virus-induced MS in which suppression of IL-12p70 formation by IL-2 or following macrophage depletion causes T-cell autoreactivity leading to CNS demyelination ."
"There was a slight but non-significant decrease in oxygen saturation following the depletion of CD8+ T cells , which was amplified when both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were depleted ( Fig . 4A ) .","CD8+ T lymphocytes mediate immunity to intracellular pathogens by killing infected cells . However , some pathogens are able to evade the response of CD8+ T cells and , thus , establish chronic infections . This is the case of Trypanosoma cruzi , the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease . Here , we investigated the basis of the suboptimal response of CD8+ T cells during T . cruzi infection . We observed that cells incubated with the parasite and then adoptively transferred into mice are able to convert an optimal in vivo response of transgenic CD8+ T cells specific to an unrelated epitope into suboptimal . The mechanism of this disturbance relies on the induction of regulatory CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells that interfere with the priming of CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells . These findings illustrate the involvement of regulatory T cells in the regulation of CD8+ T cell priming and contribute to understand how T . cruzi evades host immunity to establish a chronic infection ."

It is reported that ILCs are depleted in HIV-1 infected patients . However , it is not clear whether HIV-1 can infect ILCs and how ILCs are depleted during HIV-1 infection . Here , we find that ILC1s consist CD4+ and CD4- subsets and both are present in various human lymphoid organs . We show that HIV-1 can directly infect CD4+ ILC1s . HIV-1 infection leads to activation , depletion and functional impairment of ILC1s in humans and in humanized mice in vivo . Blocking IFN-I signaling prevents HIV-1-induced apoptosis of ILC1s both in vitro and in humanized mice in vivo . Our study reveals the CD4+ ILC1 population as a new target for HIV-1 infection and identifies an IFN-I mediated mechanism of ILC1 depletion during chronic HIV-1 infection ."

The prime boost group that was rechallenged 30 days after the “boost” did not experience this transient delay in weight loss and showed kinetics of morbidity similar to the LCMV Armstrong immune groups described above in terms of magnitude of weight loss and decline of lung function suggesting that the greater magnitude of GP33-specific CD8+ T cell response in this group was insufficient to mediate protection .,"The majority of infections with the betaherpesvirus human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) are clinically unnoticed , but in immunocompromised hosts HCMV infections can be severe and even fatal . Here we investigated in preclinical mouse models the efficacy and mechanisms of synthetic long peptide ( SLP ) -based vaccines eliciting mouse CMV ( MCMV ) -specific CD8+ T cells as a platform modality to protect against CMV infection . The percentages of MCMV-specific T cells in the circulation elicited by prime-booster SLP vaccination were equivalent or higher compared to those induced by the virus itself . We further show that the naive T cell precursor frequency rather than the functional avidity of T cells predicts the magnitude of SLP-induced CD8+ T cell responses . Superior protection against MCMV infection depends strongly on the combined use of distinct SLP vaccines leading to broader viral-specific responses . This finding highlights the importance of the breadth of vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses ."
"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SLC25A38 homologue YDL119c , which we name HEM25 ( Heme synthesis by SLC25 family member ) , was inactivated in the yeast genome and the level of heme was determined .","Total body iron stores in mammals is a composite of iron absorption from diet and iron recycled by macrophages from dying red blood cells ( RBCs ) . Upon erythrophagocytosis of RBCs , the hemoglobin is degraded and heme is imported from the phagosomal compartment into the cytoplasm so that the iron can be released from heme . Defects in these pathways can lead to aberrant iron homeostasis . The Heme Responsive Gene-1 ( HRG1 , SLC48A1 ) was identified previously as a heme importer in the intestine of the roundworm , Caenorhabditis elegans . In cell culture studies , HRG1 was demonstrated to mobilize heme from the erythrophagosome of mouse macrophages into the cytosol . However , the in vivo function of HRG1 remains to be elucidated . The zebrafish is a powerful genetic animal model for studying vertebrate development and ontogeny of hematopoiesis . In zebrafish , the kidney marrow is the adult hematopoietic organ that is functionally analogous to the mammalian bone marrow . In this study , we show that Hrg1 plays an essential in vivo role in recycling of damaged RBCs , and that the kidney macrophages are primarily responsible for recycling heme-iron in the adult zebrafish ."

Structure-guided functional studies reveal that ICR-Mo possesses a PE lipid substrate recognizing cavity having a role in enzymatic catalysis and the resulting bestowal of antibiotic resistance against colistin . The expression of icr-Mo in E . coli prevents the generation of ROS in response to treatment with colistin . The fact that the two domains of ICR-Mo cannot be functionally exchanged with their counterparts in MCR-1/2 validates its standing as a distinct phylogenetic entity .

When challenged 30 days later these mice demonstrated no protection against PR8-GP33 despite a very similar influenza virus-specific CD8 T cell response compared to B6 mice ( Fig . 4B and C ) .,"Vaccines against influenza typically induce immune responses based on antibodies , small molecules that recognize the virus particles outside of cells and neutralize them before they infect a cell .

The other branch of the immune system is made of killer T cells , which recognize infected cells and target them for killing . Influenza does not rapidly evolve to escape T cell killing; thus , vaccines inducing T-cell responses to influenza might provide long-term protection . We introduced an antigen from influenza into the murine cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ) and used it as a vaccine vector inducing killer T-cell responses of unparalleled strength .

SHB is positively regulated by GA signaling and encodes a direct transcriptional activator of the GA biosynthesis gene KS1 , indicating that GA modulates its own biosynthesis and consequently the elongation of meristem cells in rice roots via positive feedback regulation on the transcription of SHB and KS1 . Consistently , application of exogenous GA restored the size of root meristem cells to normal in shb and paclobutrazol-treated wild-type plants ."

Sideroblastic anemias are a group of disorders principally defined by a decreased level of hemoglobin in erythrocytes ( red blood cells ) and the presence of pathological iron deposits in perinuclear mitochondria of erythroblasts ( red blood cell precursors found in bone marrow ) [1–5] .,"The causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans is the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum . These parasites are carried by a mosquito that infects humans during feeding resulting in injection of sporozoite forms that infect and develop in the liver into the merozoite stage . The merozoites are released into the blood stream where they invade erythrocytes in which they can grow and divide . Invasion of the red blood cell by P . falciparum merozoites involves a cascade of protein-protein interactions . The P . falciparum reticulocyte binding-like homologue proteins ( PfRh or PfRBL ) are an important protein family involved in binding to specific receptors on the red blood cell . We have analysed two members of this protein family , PfRh2a and PfRh2b , and show that they undergo a complex series of cleavage events before and during merozoite invasion . We have defined the region of these ligands that bind red blood cells and show that antibodies to this receptor-binding region block merozoite invasion demonstrating the important function of this domain ."
One of the main reasons for acquired sideroblastic anemia is a nutritional deficiency in vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) as several of the enzymes required to synthesize heme and heme precursors require pyridoxal 5’-phosphate ( PLP ) as a cofactor .,The role being so enjoyable is probably one of the main reasons why there are so many governors giving up their time to help.

The implementation of this system recently resulted in the diagnosis of the first putative native sleeping sickness case since two decades .

"To this end , we implemented a multi-parameter , multi-test skin screen to identify mouse models of skin dysfunction and to elucidate genetic pathways important for skin development and function .","The earliest stage of any infection takes place when a pathogen enters the body ( inoculation ) at an initial site of contact . From this point , the pathogen can spread into deeper tissues where the pathogen itself and the immune responses against it cause disease . Very little is known about the events that follow inoculation and how pathogens move from the initial site of contact into deeper tissues . A better understanding of this process can potentially result in strategies to control or prevent disease . We studied the highly infectious bacterium that causes bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) and how it spreads inside the body , from the skin into lymph nodes . We found that movement from the skin is highly restricted as only a small fraction of the bacteria that are deposited into this tissue are found in lymph nodes . While it is currently thought that Y . pestis spreads from the skin inside trafficking cells of the innate immune response , our work suggests these cells are not required for the bacteria to move into lymph nodes . Our findings can influence vaccine development efforts as these strategies are based on the study of early pathogen interactions with cells of the immune response ."

"When given X31-GP33 serum , LCMV immune mice containing GP33-specific memory CD8+ T cells displayed significantly reduced weight loss and viral load compared to the LCMV Armstrong immune group that had received PBS or serum from naïve mice ( Fig . 6A ) .","Persistent viruses such as hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) or HIV can defeat the body's defense system and cause devastating epidemics worldwide .

Better knowledge about how a successful defense should operate is therefore essential for developing and refining new vaccines . Here , we have used a prototypic mouse model to investigate basic defense mechanisms required to eliminate persisting viruses . Experiments in several genetically engineered mouse models show that contrary to common belief , not only antiviral killer T cells , but also antibodies ( produced by B cells ) , are needed to prevent a virus from persisting in its host .

Considering the role of VNA in clearing the virus from the CNS , production of VNA within the CNS or infiltration of VNA from the periphery into the CNS across the blood-brain barrier appears to be important for clearing the virus from CNS thereby preventing a lethal rabies infection ."

In this paper , we show that NKG2D expression is decreased on NK cells from chronically infected HCV patients . As a consequence , NK cell cytolytic and IFNγ-producing functions are impaired . We show that this phenomenon is mediated by TGFβ produced by monocytes upon stimulation by the non-structural HCV-NS5A protein . NS5A could bind to TLR4 on monocytes , thus inducing the production of IL-10 and TGFβ , while inhibiting the production of IL-12 . We further showed that TLR4-dependent IL-10 production by monocytes upon NS5A stimulation was mediated through the p38 and PI3 kinase pathways . In addition , we demonstrated that IL-15 could inhibit the TGFβ-mediated effects on NKG2D expression and NK cell functions .

At least in principle , the answer to this phenomenon , which we refer to as “The Sleeping Beauty Kiss , ” might have two molecular solutions: the controlled expression of a protein that re-starts the cell cycle , or the inactivation of an inhibitory protein that prevents such a re-start . We show here that the re-start of the meiotic cycle in Drosophila depends on both mechanisms: the controlled expression of an “activator” known as Polo kinase , and the presence of a regulatory protein called Matrimony ( Mtrm ) , which binds to and physically inactivates Polo . Indeed , Mtrm is the first known protein inhibitor of Polo kinase . The excess of Mtrm prior to the time of normal meiotic re-start , keeps Polo inactive . However , either the production of an excess quantity of Polo , or the destruction of Mtrm , at the appropriate time , releases active Polo , permitting a properly controlled re-start of meiotic progression ."
"At flower stage 12 , 624 genes were expressed at a lower level in arf6-2 arf8-3 flowers than in wild-type flowers , and 312 genes were expressed at a higher level ( Figure 5 ) .","Crop yields are strongly associated with flowering time , therefore a precise understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of flowering is required to engineer varieties adapted to new or changing environments .

Extended exposures to low temperatures during winter ( vernalization ) induce VRN1 expression , which promotes flowering in the spring . VRN1 is expressed in the apices and in the leaves , but its role in the leaves is not well understood . Using two sets of VRN1 knock-out mutants , we demonstrate that a central role of VRN1 in the leaves is to maintain low transcript levels of the VRN2 flowering repressor , which allows the production of the mobile FT protein ( florigen ) required to initiate flowering . Both sets of VRN1 knock-out mutants flowered very late but , eventually , produced normal flowers and seeds , which demonstrates that VRN1 is not essential for wheat flowering .

Such proteins appear to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as prion , Alzheimer's and Parkinson's . Yeast prions also misfold into self-seeding aggregates and provide a good model to study how these rogue polymers first appear . De novo prion appearance can be made very frequent in yeast by transient overexpression of the prion protein in the presence of heterologous prions or prion-like aggregates . Here , we show that the aggregates of one such newly induced prion are initially formed in a dot-like structure near the vacuole . These dots then grow into rings at the periphery of the cell prior to becoming smaller rings surrounding the vacuole and maturing into the characteristic heritable prion tiny dots found throughout the cytoplasm . We found considerable colocalization of two heterologous prion/prion-like aggregates with the newly appearing prion protein aggregates , which is consistent with the prevalent model that existing prion aggregates can cross-seed the de novo aggregation of a heterologous prion protein . However , we failed to find any physical interaction between another heterologous aggregating protein and the newly appearing prion aggregates it stimulated to appear , which is inconsistent with cross-seeding ."
"As cross-neutralizing antibodies are not induced between the X31 and PR8 influenza strains [42]–[44] , non-neutralizing antibodies are likely contributing to protection .","Membrane fusion of HIV-1 with its target cells represents the first step in viral infection . This process involves a series of conformational changes in two viral envelope glycoproteins , gp120 and gp41 , subsequent to binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor and the chemokine coreceptor on the target cell membrane . During the fusion process , the conserved N-heptad repeat ( N-HR ) of gp41 in the form of a trimeric coiled-coil is accessible and presents an attractive target for the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies . Here we present the crystal structures of two monoclonal Fabs complexed to a mimetic of the N-HR trimer . These Fabs were derived from a synthetic human combinatorial antibody library comprising more than 1010 human specificities by first panning against an N-HR mimetic , followed by affinity maturation through targeted diversification of the CDR-H2 complementarity determining region . One of the Fabs is broadly neutralizing across a wide range of primary isolates from subtype B and C HIV-1 , whereas the other one is non-neutralizing . Our structures reveal the key role of the CDR-H2 loop in antigen recognition and how this correlates with HIV-1 neutralization properties ."

We observed that cells incubated with the parasite and then adoptively transferred into mice are able to convert an optimal in vivo response of transgenic CD8+ T cells specific to an unrelated epitope into suboptimal . The mechanism of this disturbance relies on the induction of regulatory CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells that interfere with the priming of CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells .

OmpA binds to α-chain of Fcγ-receptor I ( FcγRIa ) in macrophages , but does not induce expected gamma chain association and signaling . FcγRIa knockout mice are resistant to E . coli K1 infection because their macrophages express more CR3 and are thus able to kill bacteria with greater efficiency , preventing the development of high-grade bacteremia , a pre-requisite for the onset of meningitis . These novel observations demonstrate that inhibiting OmpA binding to FcγRIa is a promising therapeutic target for treatment or prevention of neonatal meningitis ."

To identify how the immune system responds to and provides protection from SARS-CoV infection , we have developed a mouse model that mimics many aspects of SARS-CoV disease in humans . Utilizing this mouse model , we discovered that a host gene , termed MyD88 , is required to control SARS-CoV replication and spread in lung tissue and for protection from death . In addition , MyD88-dependent functions were required for early immune and inflammatory responses in the lung following SARS-CoV infection , and the absence of these early responses correlated with severe SARS-CoV-induced disease and death . Our studies identify host immune responses that provide protection from SARS-CoV infection and provide valuable insight toward the development of successful antiviral therapies ."

With a few exceptions ( n = 24/532 ) the mice were generated from C57BL/6N ES cells and maintained on this genetic background .,"In organisms such as fruit flies and humans , major chromosomal differences exist between the sexes: females have two large , gene-rich X chromosomes , and males have one X and one small , gene-poor Y . Various strategies have evolved to balance X-linked gene expression between the single X and the autosomes , and between the sexes ( a phenomenon called dosage compensation ) . In Drosophila melanogaster , expression from the male X is up-regulated approximately 2-fold , thereby balancing both X-to-autosome and female-to-male expression . In contrast , mammals silence one of the two female Xs in a process requiring the untranslated RNA product of the Xist gene . This balances female-to-male expression but leaves both sexes with only one functional X chromosome . Using mouse embryonic stem cells and microarray expression analysis , we found that dosage compensation in mice is more complex than previously thought , with X-linked genes up-regulated in both male and female cells so as to balance X-to-autosome expression . As differentiation proceeds , female cells show progressive loss of expression from one of the two initially active Xs . Surprisingly , silencing occurs on a gene-by-gene basis over 2–3 week of differentiation; some genes escape altogether , whereas a subgroup of genes , often adjacent to the Xist locus , is silenced even in undifferentiated cells . We propose that female X-linked genes are silenced by progressive spreading of Xist RNA through the X chromosome territory as differentiation proceeds ."

The pattern of β-gal reporter gene activity was determined by lacZ labelling of whole mount tissue preparations from heterozygous knockout .,"In many tissues , defective cells are eliminated by a process called apoptosis . This process prevents the emergence of rogue cells , which could be detrimental to normal physiology . Apoptosis is particularly apparent in developing embryos that lack appropriate positional information , and it has been suggested that in the absence of clear positional instructions , cells are unable to acquire a defined fate and commit suicide as a result . Here , we have used mutant fruit fly embryos lacking essential segmental determinants to identify the molecular signals that trigger apoptosis in response to mispatterning . We found that cells do not trigger apoptosis in response to conflicting fate determinants . Instead , mispatterning disrupts a tissue size control system that removes excess cells in oversized segments . Specifically , correct patterning information leads to the segmentally repeated production of survival signals , which activate the epidermal growth factor receptor , and this system is disrupted in patterning mutants leading to reproducible patterns of apoptosis . We propose that a similar , though less obvious , process also occurs in normal embryos . In such embryos , each segment would initially comprise a slight excess of cells and would then be trimmed down to a size specified by the pattern of survival signal production and the range of these signals . We suggest that a similar regulatory logic could ensure the coordination of tissue patterning and size in a variety of developing tissues ."

We previously made the discovery that cells infected with influenza virus do not have a death sentence . An infected cell can survive both influenza virus infection and the immune response to eliminate the virus , specifically CD8+ T cells which are required for virus clearance . Here , we investigated how an infected cell could survive the CD8+ T cell immune response . We used an influenza virus expressing a recombinant protein that permanently labels infected cells in inducible reporter mice . This system allowed us to detect actively infected cells , as well as cells that had survived influenza virus infection and CD8+ T cell-mediated killing , called survivor cells . We demonstrate that survivor cells do not actively block CD8+ T cell effector function and are not inherently resistant to CD8+ T cell-mediated killing . Our data suggest that survivor cells have lost influenza virus antigen and are rendered invisible to virus-specific CD8+ T cells . Our research provides important new insight into the mechanism of how survivor cells can be generated . This could be a mechanism by which the host is protecting the lung from greater pathology during influenza virus infection ."

Here we show that recombinant Pmp21 functions as an invasin protein . Using a biochemical approach we identified the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) — an ubiquitously expressed cell surface-localized receptor tyrosine kinase — as the cellular receptor for Pmp21 , making Pmp21 the first pathogen-derived EGFR ligand . The EGF receptor is recruited to adherent and internalized EBs . Depletion of EGFR from the human cell surface significantly reduced chlamydia adhesion and internalization . Likewise , ectopic expression of EGFR in receptor-negative cells increased chlamydia adhesion , internalization and subsequent infectivity . Binding of Pmp21 to EGFR initiates receptor activation and downstream signaling , both of which we found to be equally important for bacteria entry . In conclusion , we show that the Pmp21 adhesin binds and activates EGFR , which initiates signaling cascades , finally leading to chlamydia/receptor internalization ."

Cryoglobulins , which are immunoglobulins that precipitate when temperature is below 37°C , can induce rheumatic and vascular disorders . From April 2005 through May 2007 , we screened all patients with possible imported Chikungunya infection for cryoglobulins . They were present in over 90% of patients , and possibly responsible for the unexpected false negativity of serological assays . Cryoglobulin frequency and levels decreased with time in recovering patients ."
The images were processed for morphometrical analysis using Leica confocal software .,"Control and development of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( CL ) are dependent on the host immunological response . One of the key molecules in determining elimination of Leishmania parasites from the infected host cell is the cytokine interferon gamma ( IFN-γ ) . The aim of this study was to investigate which immune response genes are associated with the production of IFN-γ in the context of Leishmania infection . We identified individuals that are high- or low IFN-γ producers upon stimulation of their peripheral blood cells with Leishmania parasites . We then determined the immune gene expression profile of these individuals and we identified a set of genes that are differentially expressed comparing high- and low IFN-γ producers . The expression of these genes was also evaluated in patients with CL and in individuals with a subclinical Leishmania infection ( SC ) . In this setting , the overall pattern of expression of this particular gene combination discriminated the CL patients x from SC individuals . Understanding the initial response to Leishmania may lead to the identification of markers that are associated with development of CL ."
Pancreatic β-cells were identified by the characteristic half maximal inactivation of voltage-activated Na+ currents ( approx . −100 mV ) [44] .,"Excitable cells elicit electrical pulses called action potentials ( APs ) , which are generated and shaped by a combination of ion channels in the cell membrane . Since one type of ion channels is permeable to Ca2+ ions , there is typically an influx of Ca2+ during an AP . Pituitary cells therefore use AP firing to regulate their cytosolic Ca2+ concentration , which in turn controls their hormone secretion rate . The amount of Ca2+ that enters during an AP depends strongly on how long it lasts , and it is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that control this . Pituitary APs are generally mediated by a combination of Ca2+ channels and Na+ channels , and the relative contributions of from the two vary between cell types , animal species and biological conditions . Previous computer models have predominantly been adapted to data from pituitary cells which tend to fire Ca2+-based APs . Here we develop a new model , adapted to data from pituitary cells in the fish medaka , which APs that are predominantly Na+-based , and compare its dynamical properties to the previous models that fire Ca2+-based APs ."
"Phenotypic similarities between tsk/bru1/mgo3 mutants and fas , mre11 , rpa2 , and rnr mutants , combined with the observation that the Nicotiana tabacum homolog of the TSK/BRU1/MGO3 gene is predominantly expressed at S phase in synchronously cultured tobacco BY-2 cells suggest that TSK/BRU1/MGO3 protein is involved in the structural and functional maintenance of chromatin during DNA replication [19] , [29] .","Separating the time scale of oscillations from that of the phase dynamics allowed for reducing a network of coupled neural mass models to a system of phase oscillators . We studied the dynamics of networks of phases and their synchronization characteristics as being seminal for functional neural networks . We put particular focus on effects of time delays in the coupling on the network dynamics and contrasted that to effects due to altered structural connectivity . Does neuroanatomical structure prescribe all the macroscopic activity patterns that we observe through electrophysiological brain recordings ? We found that heterogeneity in structural coupling and distributed delays have equivalent effects on the shape of phase distributions , i . e . , on functional connectivity . The contribution of changes in structural connectivity to network synchronization can therefore not readily be distinguished from that of distributed delays . Interestingly , the emergence of phase clusters in networks requires a subtle interplay between coupling and delays , which may form a window into disentangling structural effects from those induced by delay distributions . Therefore , when investigating neural network behavior , both structural connectivity and delay distribution should be addressed ."
"The TSK/BRU1/MGO3 protein has LGN repeats and leucine-rich repeats , both of which are involved in protein-protein interactions [19] , [27] , [28] , [30] , and thus may function as a scaffold of proteins involved in DNA replication , repair , and chromatin maintenance .","Homologous recombination ( HR ) is a cellular process that permits efficient repair of both endogenous and exogenous DNA damage . Although the principal players in HR have been well characterized , the interplay of diverse processes with the HR pathway remains mysterious . Traditionally , genetic screens investigating HR have utilized genetic assays , such as survival following exposure to DNA damaging agents or alterations in the rate of the generation of recombinant products . In this work , we instead utilize a cell biology phenotype , the relocalization of the central HR protein Rad52 into subnuclear foci reflecting repair centers actively engaged in HR . This approach allows us to identify mutants that affect the kinetics of HR repair center assembly and disassembly regardless of the outcome of recombination . We identified 86 gene deletions that lead to increases in the levels of spontaneous foci in proliferating diploid cells , 22 of which were deletions of previously uncharacterized ORFs ( designated IRC2–11 , 13–16 , 18–25 ) . Genetic characterization of the mutants revealed a diversity of mechanisms that underlie the focus phenotype . These include increasing the generation of DNA lesions , blocking the completion of HR , and altering the kinetics of genetic recombination and the assembly/disassembly of the HR protein complexes ."

"Recent reports have implicated NP-specific IgG in heterosubtypic immunity to influenza virus [28] , [29] .","The response of cells to virus infection depends on Interferons ( IFNs ) , a group of cytokines which activate the expression of hundreds of genes that help control viral replication inside infected cells . While type I IFN was discovered in 1957 , type III IFN ( IFNλ , IL-28/29 ) was characterized recently and is known for its role in the response to hepatitis C virus . Airway epithelia are the primary target of influenza virus , and we studied how infection induces IFNs and which IFN is most important for the epithelial anti-influenza response . We found that infected epithelia detect virus through the cytoplasmic RIG-I/MAVS recognition system , leading to activation of the transcription factor IRF7 and subsequent induction of both type I and III IFNs . All ensuing cellular responses to infection are dependent on the production and secretion of IFNs , as responses are lost in epithelia lacking receptors for both type I and III IFNs . Finally , gene induction is indistinguishable in single receptor-deficient and wild-type cells , indicating that the two IFN systems are completely redundant in epithelia . Thus , influenza infection of airway epithelia induces , via a RIG-I/MAVS/IRF7 dependent pathway , both type I and III IFNs which drive two overlapping and redundant amplification loops to upregulate antiviral genes ."

Moreover , the number of early primed KLRG1- CMV-specific T cells in the acute phase of infection set the limit for memory T cell inflation .

"While non-neutralizing antibodies against M2e or other conserved determinants have recently been examined , our data indicate a previously unappreciated role for cooperativity between non-neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses in the induction of optimal protection from serologically distinct influenza virus strains .","CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are critical for controlling many infections . To generate a T cell response during infection , T cells must encounter the microbial peptides that they recognize bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of other cells , such as dendritic cells . It is currently unclear how dendritic cells acquire the antigens they present to T cells during infection with many intracellular pathogens . It is possible that these antigens are phagocytosed and processed by dendritic cells , or antigens may be presented by cells that are infected by pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii , which invades host cells independently of phagocytosis . To differentiate these pathways , we developed a novel technique to track the fate of T . gondii in vivo that distinguishes actively infected cells from those that phagocytosed parasites . This technique was used to examine each of these cell populations . We also used pharmacological inhibitors of parasite invasion , and the transfer of sort-purified infected or uninfected dendritic cells and macrophages to determine what roles phagocytosis and active invasion have in the initiation of T cell responses . Our results demonstrate that phagocytosis of parasites is not sufficient to induce CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responses , whereas infected cells are critical for this process ."
"Among these candidates are broadly neutralizing antibodies , which are able to target the conserved stem region of the influenza virus [60]–[64] .","SIgAs exist as mainly dimers and tetramers and play critical roles in mucosal immune responses against influenza .

Here , we describe a means of generating a recombinant tetrameric monoclonal SIgA to enable exhaustive characterization of tetrameric SIgAs . The tetrameric monoclonal SIgA possessing variable regions of anti-influenza viruses broadly neutralizing antibody show that tetramerization of SIgA improves target breadth , but not the peak potency , of their anti-viral functions .

"Thus , inactivation of the catalyzing enzyme TGase2 [16] , a lack of the monoamine substrate for serotonylation ( Tph1−/− ) , and the absence of the protein substrates Rab3a and Rab27a [18] , [19] all lead to defective insulin secretion independently .","Insulin is a glucose-lowering hormone secreted from the pancreatic -cells in response to raised plasma glucose levels , and it is now well-established that defective insulin secretion plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetes .

"The difference between the two GTPases could reflect different kinetics of inactivation by proteasomal degradation , suggesting a high selectivity of this process .","The core planar polarity proteins are responsible for polarising structures in the plane of epithelia . For example in the fly wing , the core proteins are required for cells to make hairs that point towards the distal end of the wing . The core proteins localise asymmetrically in wing cells , either at the distal cell end where the hair emerges or at the opposite cell edge . To establish this asymmetric localisation the core proteins must undergo feedback interactions with each other , and it is thought that for feedback to operate correctly , the amounts of the core proteins at junctions must be limiting . We show that the core protein Prickle is modified by a farnesyl lipid molecule . This modification is essential for it to associate with cell membranes where it can interact with another core protein , Strabismus . Interaction with Strabismus allows Prickle to participate in asymmetric complexes and feedback interactions , but Strabismus also causes degradation of excess Prickle . If Prickle doesn't interact with Strabismus , or if there is too much Prickle at cell membranes , asymmetric localisation of the other core proteins is compromised ."

"In the present study , we conducted genetic and global gene expression analyses to explore the link between DNA damage responses and developmental phenotypes of teb mutants .","Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system and affects the muscles and heart . The disease is caused by a defect in the frataxin gene , which is involved in iron homeostasis and likely protects against reactive oxygen species .

Transcriptional profiling was performed on blood samples from a cohort of 28 children compared to a control group . These data were then validated with a cohort of 14 adults with FRDA compared to a second independent control group . DNA damage was assessed on the blood samples from the 28 FRDA children , plus an additional 19 affected children , by quantitative PCR ( QPCR ) . Transcriptional profiling revealed changes in gene expression consistent with the presence of genotoxic stress in FRDA patients . This finding was supported by the direct evidence that FRDA patients accumulated significantly higher levels of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage as compared to controls .

Previous studies have shown that the checkpoint kinases ATM ( Tel1 ) and ATR ( Rad3 ) are required for stable maintenance of telomeres in a wide variety of organisms . Here , we investigated the molecular basis for telomere dysfunction in fission yeast cells lacking ATM and ATR kinases . Our results show that fission yeast ATM and ATR are redundantly required to promote efficient recruitment of telomere protection complex subunits to telomeres , which in turn promote recruitment of telomerase needed to maintain telomeres . Human ATM and ATR kinases might similarly promote telomere protection and telomerase recruitment by promoting recruitment of telomere protection complex subunits ."
"Complement has been demonstrated to be able to neutralize the influenza virus in the presence of natural antibodies [75] , and complement component C3 may be important in T cell priming and migration to the lungs [76] .","Influenza is a global health problem frequented by epidemics and pandemics . Current vaccines against influenza offer limited protection hence the need for reformulation and repeated vaccination . There is a pressing need to develop newer vaccines that are able to generate T cell response . In order to develop such vaccines , there is a need to understand how T cell responses are generated during influenza infection . Influenza specific T cell responses are generated by the dendritic cells ( DCs ) in the lung . Upon influenza infection , DCs in the lung carry viral peptides to the draining lymph node ( dLN ) to initiate an immune response . Thus , migration of DCs from the lung to the dLN is an important step in the initiation of influenza specific T cell response . We now show that activation products of the complement system interact with their receptors on the DCs , which signals for the DCs to migrate from the lung to the dLN . Thus , our results reveal a previously unknown function for complement in mediating lung DC migration during influenza infection and highlight its potential as an adjuvant in novel vaccine strategies ."

The TEP1 gene varies significantly across mosquito populations with two major classes of alleles , TEP1*S and TEP1*R . We report the three-dimensional molecular structure of the TEP1*S1 protein and compare it to the previously determined TEP1*R1 structure . Differences between the structures are localized around the active site and thioester bond , and correlate with a difference in stability of this bond within the two proteins and their interaction with a heterodimer of two other immune genes , LRIM1 and APL1C .

One of the megaspores in a fixed position survives to become the functional megaspore ( FM ) while the other megaspores undergo degeneration . The FM further develops into an embryo sac . We have been working on the functions and regulation of a family of plant cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors called ICKs or KRPs . We observed that in the ovules of Arabidopsis mutant with all seven ICK/KRP genes inactivated , multiple MMCs , FMs and embryo sacs were formed , and the embryo sacs could be fertilized to produce two embryos with separate endosperm compartments . Further , in mutant ovules the number and position of surviving megaspores from one MMC were variable and ICK4-YFP ( yellow fluorescence protein ) fusion protein was strongly expressed in the degenerative megaspores but absent in the FM . Those findings together with other results in our study indicate that multiple ICK/KRPs function redundantly in controlling the formation of one MMC per ovule and also in the degeneration of non-functional megaspores , which are critical for the subsequent development of one embryo sac per ovule and one embryo per seed ."

Interestingly , we find that at the intermediate temperature ( 18°C ) alleles from both genotypes have very similar gene expression , suggesting a strong canalization of gene expression despite substantial genetic differences . More extreme temperatures break this canalization and result in many differently expressed genes , caused mainly by trans-acting factors . Most of the expression differences are non-additive , with a swap in dominance between the two extreme temperatures ."
"Expression of PMYB21:MYB21:GUS and PMYB24:MYB24:GUS in anthers or pollen ( Figure 2 , Figure S1 ) is likely an artifact of our fusion constructs , because in situ hybridizations revealed stamen filament but not anther expression ( Figure 2C , 2E ) [14]; microarray data from dry or germinated pollen revealed no expression of MYB21 or MYB24 [22]; and X-Gluc staining was present in anthers of arf6-2 arf8-3 PMYB21:MYB21:GUS plants although arf6-2 arf8-3 flowers lacked detectable MYB21 transcript ( Figure 1A , 1B; Figure S1A–S1C ) .",Extremities : revealed no swelling

Several receptors on the surface of macrophages mediate recognition of invading pathogens , and one of these is the Macrophage Scavenger Receptor A ( SR-A ) . SR-A recognises Neisseria meningitidis , a bacterium that causes meningitis and septic shock , via proteins on the surface of the bacterium . In this study we investigated the interaction of SR-A with N . meningitidis in a mouse model for septic shock , by infecting mice with N . meningitidis and comparing a mouse strain expressing SR-A with one that does not . The health of mice not expressing SR-A deteriorated more rapidly and fewer animals survived compared to those expressing SR-A . Mice lacking SR-A had higher numbers of bacteria in their blood and also produced more cytokines that can cause septic shock . We also infected mice with bacteria that did not express two of the proteins recognised by SR-A . In this case , no differences in survival , levels of bacteria , or cytokines were detected between animals that expressed SR-A and those that did not . Therefore , we show that the macrophage receptor SR-A is protective in the development of septic shock induced by N . meningitidis ."

The complement pathway could also have an important role due to the ability of complement to bind and lyse infected cells or enveloped virus in the presence of antibodies .,"Trichinellosis is one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses worldwide . The key factor for Trichinella spiralis to survive in its host is evading from the attacks by the immune defense system . Our previous study revealed that paramyosin from Trichinella spiralis ( Ts-Pmy ) played a role in evading host immune attacks by binding to human complement C8 and C9 . Here , we demonstrated that Ts-Pmy inhibited classical complement activation by binding to human complement C1q . As a result , classical complement pathway-mediated hemolysis was inhibited in the presence of Ts-Pmy . Additionally , Ts-Pmy inhibited C1q binding to THP-1-derived macrophages and C1q-induced macrophages migration . These results suggest that Trichinella spiralis paramyosin is a potential immunomodulator involved in the evasion of the host complement attack by binding to C1q in addition to C8/C9 , and therefore is a potent vaccine target against trichinellosis ."
"Slow UV photo-release of caged Ca2+ increased intracellular Ca2+ , which peaked after about 5 s and reached a steady state value after 10 s ( Figure 3C , lower panel ) .","Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that normalizes the strength of synapses ( the structure that allows nerve cells to communicate ) and is triggered by chronic inhibition of neuronal activity . Although extensive studies have been conducted , the molecular mechanism of this synaptic adaptation is not understood .

These changes lead to an increase in GluA1-containing , calcium-permeable AMPA receptors , which mediate communication at the synapse . Newly inserted calcium-permeable AMPA receptors restore calcium currents , which enhance synaptic strength and recover calcium signaling . We also show that inhibition or activation of calcineurin activity is sufficient to induce or block synaptic scaling , respectively , suggesting that calcineurin is an important mediator of homeostatic synaptic plasticity . Taken together , our findings show that synaptic scaling is a homeostatic process that not only enhances synaptic transmission but also maintains calcium signaling in neurons under activity deprivation ."

The cellular mechanisms by which HCV replication , and subsequent virus–host interactions , may mediate liver injury are unclear . Microarray experiments were performed to characterize the host transcriptional response to HCV infection of cultured hepatocytes in an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of HCV-associated cell death . Analysis of the gene expression data revealed that many differentially regulated genes function to induce apoptosis in response to cell cycle arrest , possibly in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress . Labeling of dividing cells in culture followed by flow cytometry also demonstrated the presence of significantly fewer cells in S-phase in HCV-infected cultures relative to mock cultures , suggesting HCV infection is associated with delayed cell cycle progression . Finally , many of the cell-death–related genes whose expression changes in response to HCV infection of cultured hepatocytes were also differentially regulated in liver tissue from HCV-infected patients with histological evidence of fibrosis . In summary , HCV may mediate direct cytopathic effects through perturbation of the cell cycle which potentially contributes to liver disease progression ."
"To understand cellular defects leading to the morphological phenotypes of teb and teb atr , we first examined the extent of cell death using trypan blue staining .","Tapeworms ( cestodes ) are a medically important group of helminths that infect humans and animals all around the globe .

Praziquantel is the main drug in use against intestinal cestode infections . Development of resistance and treatment failures have been reported in trematodes , and are expected to become a problem in the future also in the case of cestode infections . Therefore , new treatment options against intestinal helminths are needed . To date , there is no in vitro-based whole-organism screening assay available that allows screening of candidate drugs with potential activity against adult cestodes . We established and characterized of a screening assay in 384-well format , which serves as a model for adult stage parasites by using Echinococcus multilocularis protoscoleces and their loss of motility as a read-out . This novel assay showed that drugs with known activity against adult cestodes inhibited motility of protoscoleces . The movement-based assay identified MMV665807 as a novel compound with profound activity against protoscoleces , and potentially also adult cestodes .

Fission yeast cells serve as a particularly attractive model system to study telomere maintenance mechanisms , since proteins critical for telomere maintenance are highly conserved between fission yeast and humans . Previous studies have shown that the checkpoint kinases ATM ( Tel1 ) and ATR ( Rad3 ) are required for stable maintenance of telomeres in a wide variety of organisms . Here , we investigated the molecular basis for telomere dysfunction in fission yeast cells lacking ATM and ATR kinases . Our results show that fission yeast ATM and ATR are redundantly required to promote efficient recruitment of telomere protection complex subunits to telomeres , which in turn promote recruitment of telomerase needed to maintain telomeres . Human ATM and ATR kinases might similarly promote telomere protection and telomerase recruitment by promoting recruitment of telomere protection complex subunits ."

However the effects of multi-strain infection on the host and the pathogen remain poorly studied . Here we show , in a mouse model , that infection of C57BL/6 mice with multiple strains of murine CMV ( MCMV ) results in profound within-host competition . Competition between the strains of MCMV is dependent on Ly49H+ natural killer ( NK ) cells . The NK cell activation receptor Ly49H receptor targets certain genotypes of the viral protein , m157 . During multi-strain infection , strains of MCMV encoding an m157 capable of binding Ly49H are excluded from the salivary gland and the saliva of C57BL/6 mice , allowing for the shedding of only non-Ly49H binding strains of MCMV in the saliva . This within-host competition could therefore have significant impacts on the circulation of MCMV strains , as only the most virulent MCMV strains were present in the saliva ."

To generate a T cell response during infection , T cells must encounter the microbial peptides that they recognize bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of other cells , such as dendritic cells . It is currently unclear how dendritic cells acquire the antigens they present to T cells during infection with many intracellular pathogens . It is possible that these antigens are phagocytosed and processed by dendritic cells , or antigens may be presented by cells that are infected by pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii , which invades host cells independently of phagocytosis . To differentiate these pathways , we developed a novel technique to track the fate of T . gondii in vivo that distinguishes actively infected cells from those that phagocytosed parasites . This technique was used to examine each of these cell populations . We also used pharmacological inhibitors of parasite invasion , and the transfer of sort-purified infected or uninfected dendritic cells and macrophages to determine what roles phagocytosis and active invasion have in the initiation of T cell responses .

One such signaling protein is NF-kB which controls the inflammatory and immune response to cytokines and pathogens . We show here that the topology of the negative circuit does not allow for frequency modulation by the signaling input . Instead , we show that a second negative feedback circuit may be tuned to dampen the oscillations . In fact , the resulting dual negative feedback motif allows for better tracking of the duration of the incoming signal than the single negative feedback circuit , as well as better buffering of noise present in the incoming signal . Thus we propose that the negative feedback topology has evolved to provide complex dynamics of NF-kB in vertebrate animals and not for the purposes of oscillations ."

In previous studies , native outer membrane vesicle ( NOMV ) vaccines from mutants with over-expressed fHbp elicited broadly protective serum antibodies in mice whose fH did not bind to fHbp in the vaccine . In this study , the authors immunized transgenic mice and showed that the presence of human fH decreased serum bactericidal antibody responses to a NOMV vaccine with fHbp that bound human fH . In contrast , a NOMV vaccine containing fHbp with a single amino acid substitution that eliminated fH binding elicited nearly twenty-fold higher protective antibody responses .

"ARF6 and ARF8 thus act in several organs to promote the transition from closed buds to mature fertile flowers , and to ensure coordinated development of male and female organs , leading to efficient self-fertilization .","The male and female blocks were added to later.  In the later 1800s, housing was also built for old, frail, sick and mentally ill people."
"These results indicate that ARF6 and ARF8 trigger anther dehiscence by promoting jasmonate production , can promote or inhibit petal growth through jasmonate-dependent pathways , and regulate other aspects of flower maturation independently of jasmonate .","We think young people involved in our activities are more likely to engage positively with other parts of their education, and thus the PESOL team promote better fulfilment and achievement of young people."
"myb21 mutants had short stamen filaments and petals , and myb21 myb24 double mutants had indehiscent anthers .","Sarcomeres , the smallest contractile units of muscle , are formed by two major filament systems , the myosin containing thick and the actin containing thin filaments . Although it is well established that sarcomerogenesis involves the formation of novel actin filaments , so far it remained largely unclear how these filaments form . In this study , we show that the Drosophila and mouse members of the DAAM formin subfamily are sarcomere associated actin assembly factors . Genetic analysis revealed that dDAAM plays an essential role in thin filament formation and sarcomere organization . In addition , we demonstrate that mDaam1 is an early determinant of myofibrillogenesis . Our data suggest that besides a role at the barbed end of the thin filaments , dDAAM also functions at the pointed end where it antagonizes the capping protein Tropomodulin . Based on these observations , we propose that DAAM family formins are very good candidates for being the long sought-after muscle actin nucleators , that also promote filament elongation by assembling short actin polymers that anneal to the Z-disc anchored growing filament . Given that cardiomyopathies , muscular dystrophies and the cardiovascular disease related heart muscle degenerations belong to the major health problems worldwide , understanding the mechanism of how muscles normally form is of immense biomedical relevance ."
"The MouseOx Pulse-oximeter ( Starr Life Sciences , Oakmont PA ) was used to measure blood oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) in PR8-GP33 infected mice during the course of infection .",The boundaries have been drawn to take in as much as possible of the course of the stream and linking five distinct zones.
"Pancreatic 5-HT levels in Tph1−/− mice only reach 10% of the wild-type ( wt ) mean ( Figure 1A ) and neither pancreas mass ( Tph1+/+: 150±30 mg , n = 27; Tph1−/−: 160±40 mg , n = 30 ) nor morphology , nor the number and size of islets differ between Tph1−/− and wt mice ( Figure 1B and 1C ) .","Control of urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis is based on mass administration of praziquantel at the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommended dose of 40 mg/kg , though some countries use 60 mg/kg . This multi-country randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy ( cure and egg reduction rates three weeks post-treatment ) and safety of these two doses for treating intestinal schistosomiasis in 856 patients in Brazil , Mauritania and Tanzania ( Schistosoma mansoni ) , and The Philippines ( S . japonicum ) . Transmission and infection intensities varied across the sites , but there was no bias or heterogeneity in efficacy outcomes . The two doses are equally effective in curing intestinal schistosomiasis; the higher dose may be less well tolerated , though effects are generally mild and transient . In endemic areas people can be re-infected; one year post-treatment patients on 60 mg/kg had fewer re-infections but this finding is difficult to explain . This study was conducted to respond to the demand for evidence about the dose of praziquantel when deployed in endemic countries . The results , along with those of systematic reviews , support the current WHO recommendation for using praziquantel at 40 mg/kg and should inform policy decisions in countries . The Philippines has already changed from 60 to 40 mg/kg after this study ."
"Concordant to the lack of peripheral 5-HT in Tph1−/− mice , they are hypersensitive to the satiety mediating effect of systemically applied 5-HT ( Figure S1 ) .","Levels of neurotransmitter serotonin synthesis shape disparate behaviors in evolutionary diverse organisms , but the mechanisms defining steady state serotonin synthesis in functionally distinct neuronal types remain unknown . A genetic screen for neuron-specific serotonin synthesis mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed a unique Gβ GPB-1 signaling pathway operating in specific serotonergic neurons to define the baseline expression of serotonin synthesis rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase tph-1 . Unlike in canonical heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathways where Gα subunits drive downstream effectors , we found that signaling through Gβ GPB-1 to the OCR-2 TRPV channel defines the baseline tph-1 expression . This Gβ signaling is not required for the establishment or maintenance of the serotonergic cell fates , but dedicated to set steady state 5-HT synthesis in mature neurons . Behavioral analyses showed that 5-HT synthesized in different neurons modulates distinct innate rhythmic behaviors . Our work identified a Gβ-mediated signaling pathway operating in differentiated neuronal cells to specify intrinsic functional diversities , and illuminate a mechanistic principle for genetic programming of neuron-specific steady state 5-HT synthesis in dedicated behavioral circuits ."
"In addition , the basal blood glucose concentrations in freely feeding mice are significantly elevated relative to those in wt mice ( Figure 1D ) , while none of the other pancreatic markers in extensive serological screenings are altered in Tph1−/− mice ( Table S1 ) .","Schistosomiasis is a global health concern that affects primarily tropical and subtropical areas . During a schistosome infection , the eggs are trapped in the host liver and products derived from eggs induce a polarized Th2 response , resulting in granuloma formation and eventually fibrosis . Thus , it is important to elucidate the mechanism of granuloma formation and fibrosis development . Here , we show that activated macrophages play a novel role in the promotion of hepatic granuloma formation and liver fibrosis in a Schistosoma japonicum-infected mouse model . In addition , M2b polarization induced by egg products was dependent on enhanced NF-κB signaling mediated by the MyD88/MAPK pathway in a TLR2-dependent manner . Our findings reveal a novel role and mechanism of M2b polarization in the liver pathogenesis in S . japonicum-infected mice ."
"Concordantly , fasted Tph1−/− mice exhibited significantly higher blood glucose concentrations than wt animals in glucose tolerance tests ( Figure 1E ) .","The liver is the major organ for glucose and lipid metabolism; impairment in liver energy metabolism is often found in metabolic disorders . Traditionally , excesses in macronutrients ( fat and glucose ) are linked to the development of metabolic disorders . Our study provides evidence that imbalances in a micronutrient , vitamin B1 ( thiamine ) , can serve as an etiological cause of lipid and glucose disorders and implicates the organic cation transporter , OCT1 , in these disorders . OCT1 is a key determinant of thiamine levels in the liver . In humans , reduced-function polymorphisms of OCT1 significantly associate with high LDL cholesterol levels . Using Oct1 knockout mice , we show that reduced OCT1-mediated thiamine uptake in the liver leads to reduced levels of TPP—the active metabolite of thiamine—and decreased activity of key TPP-dependent enzymes . As a result , a shift from glucose to fatty acid oxidation occurs , leading to imbalances in key metabolic intermediates , alterations in metabolic flux pathways , and disruptions of various metabolic regulatory mechanisms . The extensive characterization of Oct1 knockout mice provides evidence for the molecular mechanisms responsible for various metabolic traits and indicates an important role for imbalances in micronutrients in cardiometabolic disorders ."
Young adult Tph1−/− mice also present a mild insulin resistance ( Figure 1F ) .,"For more information, access the 'Young Carer, Parent and Adult Carer Strategy' supporting documents."
Glucose tolerance tests with simultaneous glucose and insulin measurements then revealed a primary β-cell dysfunction in glucose-induced insulin secretion ( Figure 2 ) .,"Insulin is a glucose-lowering hormone secreted from the pancreatic -cells in response to raised plasma glucose levels , and it is now well-established that defective insulin secretion plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetes . The -cells are electrically active , and use electrical activity to transduce an increase in glucose metabolism to calcium influx , which triggers insulin release . Experimental and theoretical studies on -cells from rodents have provided valuable insight in their electrophysiology . However , human -cells differ from their rodent counterparts in several aspects including their electrophysiological characteristics . We show that the electrophysiological responses in human -cells to a range of experimental manipulations are heterogeneous . We extend a previous mathematical model of electrical activity in human -cells to investigate such heterogeneous and nonintuitive electrophysiological responses , and use our findings to obtain insight in previously published insulin secretion measurements . By adding a glycolytic component to the electrophysiological model , we show that oscillations in glucose metabolism might underlie slow oscillations in electrical activity , calcium levels and insulin secretion observed experimentally . We conclude that the interdisciplinary combination of experiments and modeling increases our understanding of human -cell physiology and provides new insight in -cell heterogeneity ."
"These search methods yielded a total of 318 studies; after a critical perusal of titles and abstracts , 244 were excluded for failing to fulfil the main eligibility criteria ( series reports with a complete clinical description ) .",The expert witness's opinion was not allowed in court because it wasn't based on reliable and accepted scientific methods.
"A key to the understanding are recent advances in our knowledge of intracellular 5-HT functions , for instance during mammary gland involution , primary hemostasis , or liver regeneration [11]–[13] , which have led to the concept of “microserotonergic systems” in peripheral tissues in contrast to the traditional view of 5-HT as a pleiotropic hormone .",Evidence that is discovered as a result of an illegal search or questioning is also considered illegal and cannot be used in court.
"Thus , we examined the expression of ARF2 , ETT , and ARF4 in teb and teb atr .","Why do some individuals live longer than others ? Unexpectedly , genetic differences contribute surprisingly little to lifespan variation in humans . The situation is thrown into relief in studies of C . elegans , in which genetically identical siblings reared in identical environments usually experience different lifespans . In this work , we show that physiological differences between identical animals begin to appear relatively early in life and that markers of ill health in young adulthood presage shorter lifespans . Using fluorescent markers to examine the level of activation of several genes , we found three regulatory microRNA genes that vary in activity between individuals in a manner that predicts future lifespan . Moreover , two of these regulate insulin signaling , which is well known to alter lifespan in diverse species when experimentally manipulated . This indicates that different levels of insulin signaling in otherwise identical individuals may determine differences in lifespan ."
"To examine the effect of increased expression of ETT and ARF4 on the phenotype of teb , we analyzed teb ett and teb arf4 mutants .","Intellectual disability is defined by having an intelligence quotient of less than 70 points , and it affects about 2–3 people in every 100 . Obesity is defined as having a body mass index of over 30 in adults or over the 95th centile in children . Both of these conditions are major public health concerns in Western countries . Genetic studies have shown that small missing pieces of chromosome ( deletions , which remove many genes ) and changes to the lettering of genes ( which stop the gene from working , mutations ) can cause intellectual disability or obesity . Here we identified 9 children with intellectual disability and obesity who have mutations in a gene called MYT1L . This gene is thought to give an important instruction for brain development . To find out what the effect of loss of MYT1L is on brain development we reduced the levels of MYT1L ( using a special chemical ) in an experimental zebrafish . This showed that loss of MYT1L in zebrafish causes a problem with the development of the hypothalamus , which may explain how MYT1L mutations cause obesity in humans . In the zebrafish there was also reduction of a brain hormone called oxytocin which is involved in thought processes , which may explain why MYT1L mutations cause intellectual disability . We have identified a new genetic condition caused by MYT1L mutations , further study of this gene will help us understand , and treat , intellectual disability and obesity ."
"Since overexpression of ETT and ARF4 alone does not cause any defect in adaxial-abaxial polarity or cause ectopic expression of FIL in mutants affected in the ta-siRNA pathway [44]–[46] , abnormal expression of some other gene is probably responsible for the leaf polarity defect of teb .","Mobile traders cannot park in bad places, or create danger."
This additive effect of teb and ago7 or rdr6 on the expression of the ETT and ARF4 genes suggests that TEB regulates expression of ETT and ARF4 by a pathway different from the ta-siRNA pathway .,"The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is a major vector of human malaria , a disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites that results in more than half a million deaths each year . Several signaling pathways in the mosquito have been shown to mediate the mosquito immune responses to Plasmodium infection . In this manuscript we investigated the participation of the Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway in mosquito defense responses . We found that JNK signaling is required for mosquito midgut cells to induce expression of two enzymes , HPx2 and NOX5 , that mediate epithelial nitration in response to parasite invasion . These reactions modify the parasites and promote activation of the mosquito complement-like system that results in parasite lysis . The JNK pathway also regulates the basal level of expression of TEP1 and FBN9 , two key components of the complement-like system that are produced by hemocytes and secreted into the mosquito hemolymph . Our studies revealed that JNK signaling plays a key role for mosquitoes to limit Plasmodium infection , making it an important determinant of malaria transmission to humans ."
"Helitrons are a class of DNA transposons recently discovered in a number of eukaryotes , and they and their nonautonomous derivatives constitute more than 2% of the A . thaliana genome [51] .",The new software version was removed and the system was returned to the previous version after a serious error was found.
"The Helitron-like sequences upstream of ETT and ARF4 are nonautonomous elements designated AtREP3 and AtREP1 , respectively [51] .","Diversity-generating retroelements function through a unique , reverse transcriptase–mediated “copy and replace” mechanism that enables repeated rounds of protein diversification , selection , and optimization . The ability of DGRs to introduce targeted diversity into protein-coding DNA sequences has the potential to dramatically accelerate the evolution of adaptive traits . The utility of these elements in nature is underscored by their widespread distribution throughout the bacterial domain . Here we define DNA sequences and structures that are necessary and sufficient to direct the diversification machinery to specified target sequences . In addition to providing mechanistic insights into conserved features of DGR activity , our results provide a blueprint for the use of DGRs for a broad range of protein engineering applications ."
"In all tissues , red blood cells ( RBCs ) were lysed using ACK lysing buffer ( Quality Biologicals , Gaithersburg , MD ) , and lymphocytes were washed and counted .","Bovine African trypanosomosis is a parasitic disease of veterinary importance that adversely affects the public health and economic development of sub-Saharan Africa . Anemia is a major cause of death associated with this disease . Yet , the mechanisms underlying anemia development are not elucidated , which hampers the design of effective therapeutic strategies . We show here that in a Trypanosoma congolense infection mouse model relevant for bovine trypanosomosis , red blood cells ( RBCs ) are generated in the spleen . This compensates for the impaired maturation of RBCs occurring in the bone marrow , the normal site of RBC generation , and for the destruction of RBCs taking place in the liver and the spleen . Instead , anemia results from an increase in blood volume ( hemodilution ) . The immune molecule Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor ( MIF ) was found to drive RBC destruction , to block RBC maturation , as well as to trigger hemodilution . Iron accumulation in tissue due to sustained RBC destruction and hemodilution causes tissue damage , which culminates in the release of toxic molecules like bilirubin , in impaired production of blood detoxifying molecules like albumin , and in defective coagulation . Combined , these effects initiate multiple organ failure that can reduce the survival of infected mice . Given the unmet medical need for this parasite infection , our findings offer promise for improved treatment protocols in the field ."

"In some instances to verify that the antibodies present in the serum were responsible for any protective effects , serum was depleted of IgG and IgA using Protein A and G SpinTrap ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) according to manufacturer's instructions .","Because urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) are a significant healthcare burden , it would be beneficial to develop a vaccine to prevent uncomplicated UTI caused by Escherichia coli . Using a large-scale screening process we uniformly identified proteins involved in iron uptake as potential vaccine candidates against E . coli . Iron acquisition is a critical function required by bacteria in order to cause infections . In uropathogenic Escherichia coli , this function is mediated by a repertoire of systems that scavenge iron from the host during infection . We found that vaccination with certain iron receptors from these systems is sufficient to elicit protective immunity from experimental urinary tract infection . Induction of an antibody response played a key role in protection from infection because antibody class-switching and the production of antibodies in urine correlated with reduced numbers of bacteria in the bladder . By targeting an entire class of molecules involved in iron acquisition instead of a single protein , it was possible to successfully identify components of a protective UTI vaccine . This strategy could be a useful approach in the development of vaccines to prevent infections caused by other pathogenic bacteria ."
